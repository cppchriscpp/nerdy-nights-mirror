# TODO Items
- Create one big zip of entire site (convert .php to a html file, give everything else)
- Upload to cpp.net
- Make git repo public too
- Fancy: search bar?
- Look at zophar urls and fix
- License info
- Proper readme
- Add in comments after original post
  - How: "view comments" button after main; displays a pile of the comments (don't bother paginating)
  - Probably need to go through these for links and other stuff too... may have to refactor slightly
