# TODO Items
- Make git repo public too
- Look at zophar urls and fix
- Add in comments after original post
  - How: "view comments" button after main; displays a pile of the comments (don't bother paginating)
  - Probably need to go through these for links and other stuff too... may have to refactor slightly
