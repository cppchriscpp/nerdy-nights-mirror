					You know, since I made that post I had been thinking about it.  I came up with the solution of &quot;adding $FF or $FE&quot; to subtract.  But I like that the assembler will interpret the numbers for you.  That makes life a lot easier.  I will have to make another stab at it.  I must have been doing something retarted like $-01 or something before.
