					Cool, thanks guys.  I&apos;m working on this right now, actually.  Got the code re-written to jump 32 tiles by setting bit 2 of $2000 to one.  Just got that part done.  Now I&apos;ll start re-writing it by incorporating the bit tests.  Hopefully work stays nice and slow all day (knock on wood) so I can make some good progress.  You never know when my company and its clients will get annoying and actually expect me to be productive, though.  ;-)
