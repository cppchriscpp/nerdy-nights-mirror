<br>My game is comming along.  I haven&apos;t made too much progress recently due to the minor inconvinence of a certain test that I just got through.  But now I&apos;m getting back to it.  I have spent some substantial time reoragnizing, rewriting stuff OUT of NMI, making my own compression scheme, and implimenting CHR-RAM stuff.  <img src="images/blank.gif" border="0" style="display: none;" original-src="/media/_images/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif">  After all that, I got a bug into one of my sprites somehow that is being really fucking irratating...I need to figure out what&apos;s wrong before I move on.  Then music/sfx and then onto levels!
