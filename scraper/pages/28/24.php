	Could someone explain the Offscreen_buffer_tables.i to me? When I try and implement my own metatiles, and leave the file alone, it causes the assembler to freak out and throw a bunch of errors.</div>

Not sure this is what you are looking for, but maybe this could help:<br>

It may not have anything to do with the buffer file, but I&apos;ve been attempting to modify the engine to work with my graphics. I replaced the Mario chr file with my own chr file, and reprogrammed my own metatiles and levels, but when I assemble the program it says it doesn&apos;t recognize any of the variables (leftright, sleeping, soft_2000, etc. And even all the .word&apos;s and .db&apos;s, they all say something like &quot;UNDEFINED&quot;. I don&apos;t know why this is but I thought it may have something to do with the buffer file since that&apos;s the only thing I didn&apos;t change, and I don&apos;t really know how it works.
