					Cool, hopefully it is of some use to somebody.  It&apos;s always good to hook up the Right Nut.  :-)  I&apos;m not even really sure what I&apos;m going to use it for, to be honest.  I&apos;m just having fun playing around with stuff like this.  Oh, and don&apos;t forget about that scrolling demo I found at nesdev, too.  I listed it above and it might be helpful.  I just haven&apos;t opened it up and studied it too deeply to see what&apos;s in it, yet.

<br>Hey, I haven&apos;t seen any updates on your game in awhile.  How&apos;s it coming along?
