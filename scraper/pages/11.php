					People are starting to complete the Nerdy Nights tutorial series and we&apos;re seeing a lot of new homebrewers in the forum.&#xA0; This is great!&#xA0; One question that a lot of people ask after finishing up their Pong game is &quot;how do I do sound?&quot;&#xA0; Well, I hope to teach you <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0">.<br><br>The plan is to have a series of tutorial that take you from having no sound to having a working music/sfx engine.&#xA0; We&apos;ll start very simple (making a beep) and work our way up.&#xA0; These tutorials will assume that you have completed the original Nerdy Nights tutorials (I won&apos;t reteach binary or 6502).<br><br>And I&apos;m going to steal bunnyboy&apos;s disclaimer and re-use it as my own:<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And finally these will not be without errors to begin with and may not
be the absolute best way to do anything. People develop their own
programming styles and this is just mine...</span><br>
