					First of all, thanks a lot, BunnyBoy, for these tutorials.  I&apos;ve learned a lot and made it all the way through in a couple of weeks, and have managed to get a lot of key parts of my game working as proof of concept code already.  But now I&apos;ve been working through the example in this lesson and trying to figure out CHR RAM, but not having a lot of luck.  I&apos;m looking to use CHR RAM to draw custom tiles.  The example program here is all about loading a lot of text (and from the .ineschr 0 at the beginning I guess doesn&apos;t even use CHR RAM) but I&apos;m trying to figure out how to just draw some pixels.  I changed the first two lines, removed the text file loading, and started removing a lot of the text printing code, but I am having trouble seeing clearly what is the core of the CHR RAM code.  Let&apos;s say I want to do nothing but update a few tiles of background with some random pixels.  Can anybody point me toward a minimal sample?  Or suggest what the minimal steps would be?
