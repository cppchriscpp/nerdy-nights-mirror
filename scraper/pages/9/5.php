					Yes, this is very helpful.  I posted a variant of the first method in my dev blog sometime back.  It took me a VERY long time to make it work correctly, and after that, make it work as a loop for all the different counters visable on screen...then add stuff to make it maximum and minimum out.  I never thought to look on nesdev for it.  <img src="images/blank.gif" border="0" style="display: none;" original-src="/media/_images/expressions/face-icon-small-tongue.gif">  I&apos;ll have to experiment with the second one.  Looks nifty.  Thanks again!
