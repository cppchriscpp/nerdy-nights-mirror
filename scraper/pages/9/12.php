					So I have the 16-bit example working (the last one), but it is doing some screwy things. Like, when a button changes the values, it resets to zero (once) before adding/subtracting at the correct rate. Unless I run the routine twice when loading the game state, then the desired number is preserved, and the addition/subtraction adds or subtracts from that value. So I guess my question is, using the last example, how does one modify the values correctly? I could keep making it work the way that I have it, but frankly it bothers me that I cannot figure out why it is doing this. It (or something else) is also messing with my subtraction routines some, I think.
