To be honest, I&apos;m not sure at this point . Sadly, all I know is that my addition and subtraction routines work flawlessly, so far as I&apos;ve been able to test them. Can&apos;t really argue with results, but I&apos;m still curious about the transfer of values (or why a simple transfer won&apos;t work, but an addition is required).</div>

I would need to see the bad code and the rom in action so I can watch the hex values change. Otherwise, I&apos;m just blindly shooting answers from the hip.<br>

If you don&apos;t want to post it here, hit me with a pm and we can email or something.<br>
