He already realized that, Jack. That&apos;s why I asked for another actual example that contains the problem that he has questions with.</div>
<br>
That&apos;s what I was thinking too. That&apos;s why I said in my post above there is something I likely still miss about his question. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
I&apos;ve been reading the bunnyboy examples in the first post, and none match this snippet of code he posted, but probably is just me not understanding exactely what this snippet of code he posted is for. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
HexValue and TempBinary are names that suggest me nothing pratical: there are two values, which seems have to be added. If I knew what they refer to I could understand (and hopefully help) better.<br>
However, I was just trying to help, hope my post didn&apos;t sound redundant, that was not the intention. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
