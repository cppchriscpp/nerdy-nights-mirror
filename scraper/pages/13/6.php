					Allright, and can we also update parts in our nametables here?
<br>Or is it a bad practice?
<br>
<br>What I am trying to do is to evaluate the ability to put the sprite 0 in the middle of the screen, and then manage the top and the bottom part to scroll independantly.
<br>I don&apos;t know if it is possible.
<br>
<br>Thanks.
