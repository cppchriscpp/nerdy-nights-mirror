					VRAM access is not possible during active rendering, so no nametable or palette updates. Changing rendering parameters is possible, like switching to another CHR bank or changing scroll value.<br>

Independent scroll of top and bottom parts of the screen is possible. But it is not really related to the Sprite 0 hit, as it is only one of methods of catching specific scanline. The same could be done with well timed code, or with a mapper with scanline IRQ.
