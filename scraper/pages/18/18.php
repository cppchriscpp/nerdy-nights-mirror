					Hi All,<br>
<br>
I search the skeleton.zip originally wrote for NESASM3. Some one know somewhere I can find this? The link is broken.<br>
<br>
I found an Nerdy Nights ca65 Remix at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ddribin/nerdy-nights/src" target="_blank" original-href="https://bitbucket.org/ddribin/nerdy-nights/src">https://bitbucket.org/ddribin/ner...</a>. but not the original file. I try to recreate it from ca65 files, but I have difficulties.
