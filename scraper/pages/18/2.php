					well, this is neat, was able to add back the staccato sound I had in my splash page. A few things I was wondering though. will probably be covered in the next tutorial.
<br>
<br>1) what if I don&apos;t want an envelope? We split the byte between Duty cycle and Volume in this tutorial. The Volume is controlled solely by the envelope byte now. since this is an expected byte in the header, I have to put some value in. Do you make an envelope with just OF, OF, OF, etc. or is there a simpler way?
<br>
<br>2)This will probably be covered by Opcodes. Will opcodes allow my to change the Duty Cycle and envelope mid-stream? Say I want to start with a staccato then change to something else. or change the duty cycle. I would think I may want to change the tempo maybe also.
