					Hey, has someone been reading my SMS tutorial? This runs almost the same as it... Awesome idea though. Very well written, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d call this a good tutorial for people with no knowledge. If that&apos;s the case, you REALLY need to explain everything. It might be best to explain what the accumulator does before you introduce assembly, like explain this very basic so people can understand easier. Like have a WHOLE section explaining the MPU system piece by piece. But seriously, very awesome man, a good reference. Would be nice to put it on the main site in some way.&#xA0;&#xA0; Also, I just skimmed some stuff real quick, but you mentioned negative numbers and I didn&apos;t see any indication that you explained signed binary or complements in there.&#xA0; I may have missed it though, and I guess it isn&apos;t really important.
