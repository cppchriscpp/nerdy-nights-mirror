I definitely understand for the most part what your code is trying to accomplish. I was easily able to add it to my code. However, it still puts that score in the bottom left corner. Thats exactly where I was writing the numbers to before. I see how &apos;LDA PPUData&apos; allows for horizontal adjustment. But I&apos;m really trying to get this score to the top of the screen. Is there more information on the vertical adjustment somewhere.
