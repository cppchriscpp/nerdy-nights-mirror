					I understand the concept of buffers as explained in <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_frame_and_NMIs" target="_blank" original-href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_frame_and_NMIs">https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.p...</a> but I dont understand how to set it up.  It seems like it takes the place of setting a variable for each thing you want to keep track of, which I like, but coming from a background of higher languages it seems you would want to use an array, but in this case a collection of bytes.  Just not sure how to set this up in NESASM.
