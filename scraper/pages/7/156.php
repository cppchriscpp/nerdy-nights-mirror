					As a tip, the scroll should be 100% updated at the end of your NMI! The LAST thing done, ALWAYS. 100% updated means writing $2000, too. You need to do this because $2006 and the scroll registers actually use the same values. It&apos;s complex to explain, it&apos;s not needed without mid-screen scrolling, so basically just set the scroll last and you&apos;ll never have to worry about it.
