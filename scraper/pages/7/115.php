					ohhh great to know!!
<br> 
<br>and i have looked at the code for the joypad and basicly you just skip the instruction if you are pressing the same button as the previous frame.
<br>
<br>Ive got an other question!
<br>Let&apos;s say i want to make a game with a gun, the gun would shoot 1 bullet (sprite) every half second if i hold the A button... how do i do that?
<br>I&apos;ve read that their is 60 frame per second so basicly it reads the code 60 times per second??
<br>So could i do a counter and just fire everytime the counter hit 30 then reset the count blablabla.
<br>Or am I completly misunderstanding the situation here lol
