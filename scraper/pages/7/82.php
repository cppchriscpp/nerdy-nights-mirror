Makes sense, I hadn&apos;t thought to store the offsets as data and refer to them.&#xA0; And you&apos;re right, definitely not pretty as far as doing 4 INXs haha.&#xA0; But, I think I can safely clean some of it up because I won&apos;t need to set tile number/attributes/x-pos every loop through NMI so I can move those out of that.&#xA0; Thanks! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
