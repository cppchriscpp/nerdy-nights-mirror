					Can someone please help me?
<br>I can&apos;t for the life of me figure out how to display a score.
<br>
<br>So I got how to make the paddle, and I can make the ball collide with it.
<br>I added a pleasant looking background, fixed the colors just right, and even changed the sprites to look more like what they&apos;re supposed to represent.
<br>I have the looping background loader, which gets its hex values from a .db .
<br>I know that the digits have to be in the background, so how do I change the background tiles to be the digits I want them to be?
