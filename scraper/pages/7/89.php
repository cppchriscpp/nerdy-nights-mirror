					Yeah it&apos;s definitely something to look out for.  Different graphics systems use different graphics handles.  The NES PPU appears to place the coordinate of the sprite in the middle, which is the easiest in my opinion.  I&apos;ve seen certain systems use a handle in the upper left hand corner of the graphic which is a nightmare to code for.
