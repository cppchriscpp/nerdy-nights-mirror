					Ok so this is an old thread I know, I have been going through the tutorials and have everything working except updating the score.  I didn&apos;t see this explained anywhere but the comments say to update using background tiles or lots of sprites.  I would figure updating using background tiles is best since the background tile numbers correspond to the numbers so &apos;0&apos; = $00 &apos;1&apos; = $01 and so on.  The problem I am having is updating the background sprites.  I can t seem to figure out how to do it and searching google I cant find an answer.  Anyone have an example?  I would figure I would need to update the background table which I can do (I think) but how to push it to the ppu correctly.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
