					Look at the .fns file NESASM3 makes, and find the RAM label that the controller is going to to debug it via looking at the hex editor. Then look for that piece of RAM in the hex editor. You can also set breakpoints in the debugger to reads/writes/exectues to memory, including all RAM. Use all those to find/debug problems. And don&apos;t be intimidated by the hex editor, you wrote the program to use all the bytes, that&apos;s harder than reading it. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
