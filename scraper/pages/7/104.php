					Good call KHAN.  Also I was wrong about the LDX comment.  It does need to be cleared before looping but shouldn&apos;t be under the label you have. Rather you should be jumping to a label above the LDX #$00 instruction, then once the loop is started you loop to the label you currently have in your code.
