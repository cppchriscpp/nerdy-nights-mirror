Each paddle is 2 sprites, and they are stored in a variable like this:<br>
player1 .rs 2<br>
player2 .rs 2<br>
So for each player I want to check the values player(sprite 1 y value) and player+4(sprite 2 y value)+8.<br>
I tried with LDA player1+4+#$08, but obviously that didn&apos;t work. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_tongue"></span><br>All stuff that is easy in say C++ is really weird in assembly if you are not used to it.<br>
Any good resource for learning that kind of essential stuff in assembly?
