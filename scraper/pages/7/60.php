					Sorry, but the more I read, the more confused I get, so I guess I will have to spend more (of your)time<br>
here than I thought at first. x_x<br>
Your way to do it seems to be the simplest one, so perfect for a simplteton like me, but I still just sort of get it, which isn&apos;t much at all. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_sad"></span><br>
I have found some source code with different ways to handle the NMI, but none that do it the way you do it,<br>
just stuff that at the moment is way over my head.
Where would I put the drawing code if not in the NMI? In the main loop? A separate sub? What about the game states?<br>
I&apos;m having a lot of trouble figuring out where to put what in the program, and even tho I have been following along<br>the NN tutorials, some of this stuff still seems like black magic to me.<br> For instance, bunnyboy&apos;s pong code have the game states and the controller reading in the NMI, but I have seen some people say this is verry
bad, and that that code should go in the main loop. This is all verry confusing to say the least.<br>
Have I completely missed something here, or should I just go and get a 6502 for dummies or something? <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_tongue"></span>
