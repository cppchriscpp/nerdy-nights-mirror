					Sup all just want to say first that those tutorials are amazing!! thanks alot!
<br>
<br>Now i have a couple of questions so far..
<br>
<br>1. How can you clear the sprites?? when i come back to the title screen after any players have 15 points, the sprites are still on the screen with the title screen since i only updated the title background...
<br>
<br>2. Now when players have 15 points, i enter the gameover state in which i just stop moving the sprites and wait for a player the press A, and in the title screen waiting to press START. The problem is if i put both Gameover and Title state to press Start.. even if you press quickly (lol) it will pass both state.. is there a way to keep START button for both screen but not passing over the title screen. Something like making sur the buttons are unpressed before you pressed START again.
<br>
<br>Thanks!
