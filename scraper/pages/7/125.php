					Sorry, I&apos;ve been stuck here for almost a week.  
<br>
<br>&quot;Title State:
<br>  if start button pressed
<br>    turn screen off
<br>    load game screen
<br>    set paddle/ball position
<br>    go to Playing State
<br>    turn screen on&quot;
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t figure out this one.  How does one turn the screen off?  And, back on again?
