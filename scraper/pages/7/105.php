					You guys are so awesome <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
<br>
<br>TopPaddle and BottomPaddle were just old labels I had, I&apos;ve gotten rid of them now.
<br>
<br>I update all the sprites elsewhere in my code, exactly how you mentioned.
<br>
<br>Good point about LDX, I&apos;m lucky that works because X is put to #$00 before I enter that subroutine, so the way I wrote it above the label serves no purpose as you mentioned. I&apos;ll make another label there for more defensive programming, thanks for pointing that out.
<br>
<br>Changing the compare fixed it straight away!, awesome spot! I&apos;ve been caught out with that before, I&apos;ll be much more careful in the future. Thanks again guys!
