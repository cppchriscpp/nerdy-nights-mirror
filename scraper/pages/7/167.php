					It&apos;s not always a waste to do things every frame though, you can certainly lose some ease of use by over flagging stuff. Palettes have been my key example lately, thanks to some advice from Memblers. I used to do them with a complex system of flags, now I just update them every frame and skip all of the hassle of setting flag routines. It makes changing colors a breeze, and not much is lost in NMI. I think that I&apos;d do the same with scoring BG tiles at this point too, at least for a smaller game. Drawing a few tiles every frame is well within the scope of using that time well (figure that scrolling changes at least 32 and there is still time for other things).<br>

Just something to keep in mind perhaps as you continue on your journey; that constant trade between what you can do and what you need to do. What&apos;s that saying, beginning coders hardcode everything and so do veteran ones? Something like that.<br>

And of course, welcome to the forums!<br>
