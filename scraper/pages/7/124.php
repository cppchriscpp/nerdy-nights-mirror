					I&apos;m at a loss... I need to display a number using a background tile on the title screen... but graphics are only uploaded to the PPU memory once on the init code (before the JMP Forever loop). Can someone help me? Do I need to reupload BG data frame-by-frame?<br>
<br>
Edit: ooh never mind, didn&apos;t notice that you could set the PPU writing address to anywhere you wanted to. Cool <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
