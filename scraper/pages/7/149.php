					Uhhh, add one at a time to the hex number instead of 32 each time? The low part can change in 1 step pieces, this is how you set each block, just increment it what you need, which isn&apos;t by 32 like you said you did above. ($20-&gt;$40=32 steps.) Remember TV safe zones,you should put the score in the $2040 area to be super safe it&apos;ll show. Top and bottom 16px, and then left and right 8px are not safe to rely for information to appear on.<br>
<br>
And after 0x09 on the score, it will display crap, you have to have a program that turns the hex value to the right text numbers.
