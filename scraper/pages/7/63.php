					Hey, I got the background to show up properly now, but now the controller input won&apos;t work, and I have<br>
no idea why. <a href="http://pastebin.com/m15iLpnT" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/m15iLpnT...</a><br>
Would be cool if anyone could take a gander at this. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
Would that at least be a good way to handle the NMI? Or am I completely screwing up something else now?
