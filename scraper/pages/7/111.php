					Question 1: Use 2 kinds of game states, one for the logic in the infinite loop, and one for the NMI, say you call them TitleLogic/TitleNMI, PlayingLogic/PlayingNMI e.t.c.
<br>Then you just don&apos;t transfer the sprites with DMA in the game states you don&apos;t want sprites in.
<br>
<br>Question 2: <a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=22776" target="_blank">http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/...</a>
<br>Nothing about it in the tutorial, but look in the source code how he handle input there.
