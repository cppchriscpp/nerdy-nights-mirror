					It all depends on what you are comfortable with vs some optimization. Technicly you could put all your game logic in the nmi as long as you make sure to update the screen first. What most people do in my experience is either tie their main logic to nmi or have a little &quot;flag&quot; in ram that tells the main code nmi happend and that another frame has to be processed.
