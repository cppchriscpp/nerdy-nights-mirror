					Thanks for the offer, and thanks for the tip, will definitely see what I can do with that. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_happy"></span><br>
Found something interesting here too:<br>

For the buffering, so if I can&apos;t fix this now, I probably should go and read a book on<br>
computer science first. One thing tho, just to make sure I got it right. I can see in some files, like in<br>
the sound engine(from the link), that you save the registers at the beginning of NMI and restore at the end.<br>
This is so the code outside the NMI won&apos;t be disrupted, right?<br><br>Thanks for all the help!
