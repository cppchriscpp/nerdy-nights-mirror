					Thank you so much!  And what a quick response.  I did read up on buffers while I was away.  I am a c# developer so I have programming down but this is a whole new world lol.  I am grasping the concepts and the awesome tutorials.  And yes updating the same thing every frame is a definite waste lol  but at least this example allows me to grasp HOW to do a simple thing like updating a background tile.  I have been stuck the last couple of days until I realized I might just try asking <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span>  Thanks again and yes I am glad to be here.  I will read my homework!
