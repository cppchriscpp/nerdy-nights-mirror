					Huge mid game redraws are either done with the screen turned off (fade out, then back in), or are done off screen then scrolled on screen (won&apos;t be covered for a long time).  Without doing more tricks there isn&apos;t enough time to draw more than ~3 rows or columns per frame.  If you are updating non contiguous tiles then you can&apos;t do that much because resetting the ppu address sucks up time.
