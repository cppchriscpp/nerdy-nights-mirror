					I&apos;m still confused. Where exactly do I put this.&#xA0; Can it before or after RTI?&#xA0; What&apos;s at $0300?&#xA0; Would I create a ReadA, ReadB, etc section like in earlier post, or would this be done differently?&#xA0; I got the controller to work before, but I&apos;m trying to use the new savy way.
