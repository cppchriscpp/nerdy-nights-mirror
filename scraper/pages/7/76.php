			At first glance, you should be using BCC and BCS instead of BNE. But I could be wrong. BNE would only work if they are exactly on the same pixel, the others would give you a collision range.</div>

	I didn&apos;t think it was this because his speed is always no more than 1, from what I could see in his code.&#xA0; But if that fixed it, awesome.&#xA0; Nice job!<br>

Yeah, I had it at 2 first but changed it to 1, so I still think it&apos;s strange that it won&apos;t work with BEQ and BNE. :S<br>
