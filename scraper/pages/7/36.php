					<p>Well, assuming that all the formatting issues came from the file transfer, I found the following. Your ReadUpDone: and ReadDownDone: are outside of your &quot;RTS&quot; commands. <br><br>And I would say that you need to change the controller reading routine back to the old way. I&apos;ve never seen it done the way you are trying to do it, that doesn&apos;t mean it won&apos;t work, it just looks confusing to me. Why change what works? </p><p>Also, why do you have&#xA0;so many sprites on your up and down routines?</p>
