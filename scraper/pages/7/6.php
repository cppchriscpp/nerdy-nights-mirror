					(Sorry to make this the &quot;Rachel&apos;s questions&quot; thread...)
<br>It looks like all of this game is done within the NMI, correct? Couldn&apos;t you &quot;run out of room,&quot; so to speak, within the NMI time? It seems like if you had lots of graphics and/or a number of jumps from one game state to another before the completion of any game state that you would run out of NMI time.
<br>I hope that question makes sense. Even if it doesn&apos;t, asking nonsense questions is still helpful in my learning <img src="images/blank.gif" border="0" style="display: none;" original-src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif">. Thanks in advance!
