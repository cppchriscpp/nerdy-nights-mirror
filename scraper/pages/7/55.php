I&apos;m having a little trouble understanding buffering, but I will just read the NMI doc again a couple of times.<br>
One question that arose after reading it the first time tho. In bunnyboys pong files, he have the game state<br> machine in the NMI, but wouldn&apos;t this code count as logic? Shouldn&apos;t it be in the infinite loop or at least<br> somewhere outside of the NMI?
