					alright w00t! got the back of Mario&apos;s head to move! now I just got to get all the different directions to work with the whole sprite! 
<br>
<br>P.S. I love that the nesasm let&apos;s you know which line your errors are being found in. makes troubleshooting a little simpler. Since I&apos;m taking the source that you are giving and manually typing it out myself to get familiar with the syntax and data structure. Sometimes I press the wrong button and poof it doesn&apos;t work.
