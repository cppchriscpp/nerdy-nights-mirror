					<div class="FTQUOTE"><i>Originally posted by: <b>Berserker</b></i><br><br>Sorry to bump a rather old thread but...<br><br>How do I get the sprite to:<br><br>A. Move faster.

Change $01 to however fast you want it to move.&#xA0;As you get more advanced, you&apos;ll figure out the whole &quot;meta sprite&quot; deal.&#xA0; It works easier.</p><p>B. I assume that this is in reference to the &quot;$08&quot; you put in there.&#xA0; That means that you move 8 pixels per frame.&#xA0; You need to slow down if you don&apos;t want it to jump around.</p><p>C.&#xA0; I don&apos;t know, but I suspect that if you used a more advanced controller reading method, it would work better.&#xA0; Like MetalSlime uses.&#xA0; <br><br><br></p>
