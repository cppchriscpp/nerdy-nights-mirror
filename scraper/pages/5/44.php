					Doh! Reread it. That&apos;s what the latch is for. So, if I let go it won&apos;t matter as the bit will already be set and I won&apos;t lose the fact that a button was pressed. However, if you are familiar with real sized projects, just how often can this call be made to the controller, given a typical load of other code? That is, what is a likely frequency of checking the controller status per second?
