					make sense like a cut scene where the sprite is present but you don&apos;t want them moving around and such. but in the tutorials so far there hasn&apos;t been a comment that says &quot;; variable&quot;
<br>so I assume that &quot; controller1: &quot; would be a variable? and the information contained under it would be it&apos;s parameters?
