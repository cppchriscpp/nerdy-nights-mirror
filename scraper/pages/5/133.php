					Yeah, I just added the code that I thought would move the sprite up and down based on what someone else posted. Everything is in place as normal. I push the A and B buttons but they just move it left to right. I&apos;m trying to figure out how to get the sprite to move up and down using the up and down buttons. I assumed the $0200 was to set for the Y movements and $203 was for the X coordinates. I am also not getting how to move multiple sprites. I tried setting it to the 8x16 byte in $2000, but the sprite is scrabbled and the sprite is still in the same position as before.
