					I see that it&apos;s latched by 
<br>LatchController:
<br>  LDA #$01
<br>  STA $4016
<br>  LDA #$00
<br>  STA $4016       
<br>Which is the same as writing it out like that. I understand how it cycles through the buttons.  I just want to be able to make the sprite go up and down. It only goes left and right using B. BunnyBoy says to try to figure out how to move multiple sprites,figure out how to make the sprites move up and down and go left and right using the D-Pad buttons. I am not able to figure out how to do those things.
