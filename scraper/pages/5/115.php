					How do you know the location of each sprite. I gathered 203 from from reading the code, but I can&apos;t seem to find 207, 20b, or 20f anywhere.
<br>
<br>I wanted to do the &quot;homework&quot; on my own as best I could, but I had to read through the thread to figure out the location of the other three sprites. How would I locate them on my own?
