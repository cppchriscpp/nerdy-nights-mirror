If you read $4016 directly from the controller, you&apos;re doing it 100% wrong. Please don&apos;t advocate doing it that way. I&apos;m not going to argue with people again (Main reason I left for so long) how it&apos;s okay to do it how they want. It&apos;s not, it&apos;s the shittiest code you could ever write. Put it into variables, add button press variables, and stop doing it 10000% wrong.</div>
Your example is more correct (start a new thread if you want it ripped apart) for a final product, but far more complicated for an <strong>intro</strong> lesson. &#xA0;Now you need to first explain jsr/rts, variables vs constants vs addresses, <u><em><strong>naming conventions, shifting</strong></em></u>, and bcc. &#xA0;How are those tutorials you were writing going? &#xA0;</div>
<br>
WAAAH!&#xA0; I actually understood what you were talking about until you mentioned those parts I underlined in the quote!&#xA0; I was soooo close!&#xA0; [retreats to corner to sulk].<br>
&#xA0;</div>
It&apos;s not too bad. You&apos;ll be fine. These tutorials are fantastic and guide you through perfectly.<br>
