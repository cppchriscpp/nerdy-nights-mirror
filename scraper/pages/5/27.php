					I&apos;m a latecomer for the nerdy nights stuff, but maybe someone can answer my question(s).  Up until this point, I&apos;ve been using NESASM3 to follow along on the tutorials, but I want to switch over to asm6.  I attempt to code the conversion, replacing a few lines of code, but for some reason, I&apos;m getting a solid gray screen when I run the .nes file that was made from asm6.  As far as I can tell, I just need to replace the header with the ines header, and use .base directives in the place of .bank.  At this point, it&apos;s a bit frustrating, so I&apos;d really appreciate it if someone could explain the specific code changes to make.
