Actually, the part that made me laugh is that, unless I&apos;m mistaken, he hasn&apos;t mentioned subroutines yet in the tutorial, yet I have a pretty firm grounding on those.&#xA0; Likewise with variables, constants, addresses...and so on.&#xA0; I was so pleased that I understood things he hadn&apos;t even discussed yet, until I got to the underlined point.&#xA0; :-)<br>
<br>
Either way, yeah, these tutorials are a huge help in understanding the differences needed between simply writing in 6502 and writing in 6502 FOR THE NES.&#xA0; My son and I are working on a game right now and taking the step-by-step approach (step 1; learn 6502, step 2; make our character appear on the screen, step 3; make our character move in some way etc...).&#xA0; So getting my 15 sprite character to pop up and shift left and right was quite exciting for us.&#xA0; Still not quite understanding WHY the code caused it to happen, so we are sticking to the design phase while I work on wrapping my head around it, but these tutorials are being an exciting adventure for us.&#xA0; :-)<br>
<br>
edit:&#xA0; <strong>Come to think of it, would it be advisable (and speaking way into the future) to put the movement controls into a subroutine for multi-level games (ala Contra, Super Mario Bros., etc...)?</strong>&#xA0; Or can they be left in the main code block?<br>

<br>
This is the perfect way to do it. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_wink"></span><br>

I really don&apos;t&#xA0; have a lot in my main code in the few games I have written. Pretty much, all my main code block does is call subroutines.<br>
