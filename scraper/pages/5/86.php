					Sorry to bump a rather old thread but...<br><br>How do I get the sprite to:<br><br>A. Move faster. (Doesn&apos;t necessarily need to be variable, but I may be doing it wrong or there may be a better way. Code only changed for Dpad_Right)<br>B. Move more smoothly.<br>C. Move more accurately to the button press.<br><br>Thanks.<br>
