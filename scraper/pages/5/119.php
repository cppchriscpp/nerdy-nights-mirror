					Keep at it Dread, I&apos;m less than 2 months into programming and you can go a long way really fast. I was in the same boat you were just a few weeks ago, and now I have a functional game but it is no where close to done. 
<br>
<br>Many have helped me along the way. My advice, once you get through the Nerdy Nights and have a working program, go back and read it all again. It&apos;s amazing what you pick up the second, third, and fourth time through.
<br>
<br>Also, if you would like, I would can invite you to my private thread that sort of documents my journey of programming my first game. I also try to keep an up-to-date ROM posted in the first post of the private thread so you can see my bugs and play with the game mechanics.
