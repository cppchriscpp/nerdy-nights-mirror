					I can&apos;t tell you an assembler that&apos;s half modern that doesn&apos;t do that, truthfully. It lacks the nicest features IMO (+/- labels!) but it&apos;s a decent assembler still.
<br>
<br>
<br>Forewarning you, though. Don&apos;t read the controller and do the sprite movement at the same time. Store the controller value in a variable and reference it later on, because there&apos;s lots of parts in games you don&apos;t want sprites to move at all. Just telling you this now so you don&apos;t have to rediscover this bad coding problem these tutorials don&apos;t exactly say not to do. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_wink"></span> <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
