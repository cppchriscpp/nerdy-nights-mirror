					Bump your X register compare up to #$24. I&apos;d imagine you just forgot to do that after adding the four bytes for another sprite in your sprite table hehe I&apos;ve done the same thing before : )
<br>
<br>Quick question for my own curiosity. How do you add colors to your palette? I&apos;ve never really seen palette entries stored like that.<br><br>EDIT: MRN beat me to it, but it&apos;s #$24, as there are 36 bytes total. Bad MRN, BAD! ; )<br>
