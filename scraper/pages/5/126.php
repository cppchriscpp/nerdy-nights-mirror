					Okay, I got him moving good. Little Mario moves in all eight directions using the arrow keys.
<br>
<br>I forgot a dollar on 0208 for down and one his little legs fell off. I felt bad so I added it and it&apos;s working great. Kinda creepy to watch some of him move, like just his head flying off his body! 
<br>
<br>Thanks for the help guys.
