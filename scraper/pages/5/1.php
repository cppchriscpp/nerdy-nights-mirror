					need some help:
<br>
<br>1) I can make the sprite move to left and right (with the left and right buttons),
<br>but going to the left goes twice as fast.
<br>
For going left I used &quot;SBC #$01&quot; and for going right I used &quot;ADC #$01&quot;
<br>If I change ADC to ADC #$02, the speeds are equal.
<br>
EDIT: Same problem for goin up and down. Up goes twice as fast as down.<br>Anyone got an idea what I&apos;m doing wrong ? 
<br>
<br>2) And to move up, I need to subtract ? (and vica versa) Is this right ? <br><br>3) Can someone give me some extra info about including the 3 other sprites ? Can&apos;t seem to find it.<br>
