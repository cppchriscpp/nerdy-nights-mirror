If you read $4016 directly from the controller, you&apos;re doing it 100% wrong. Please don&apos;t advocate doing it that way. I&apos;m not going to argue with people again (Main reason I left for so long) how it&apos;s okay to do it how they want. It&apos;s not, it&apos;s the shittiest code you could ever write. Put it into variables, add button press variables, and stop doing it 10000% wrong.</div>
Your example is more correct (start a new thread if you want it ripped apart) for a final product, but far more complicated for an <strong>intro</strong> lesson. &#xA0;Now you need to first explain jsr/rts, variables vs constants vs addresses, naming conventions, shifting, and bcc. &#xA0;How are those tutorials you were writing going? &#xA0;<span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
