					Alright, So I came back to this and finally managed to get all the sprites moving together But now I&apos;ve come to another problem. they seem to move at different speeds in different direction. Up goes nice and slow, left goes the same speed. however Down and right go faster. I assume it has to deal with the Y and X coordinate getting&#xA0;&#xA0; loaded first for Up and Left, then for Down and right it doubles it in some respect.<br><br>I have the flag CLC&apos;ed for each sprite on each direction then SEC&apos;ed for each one in each direction. (At first I thought it was because the flag was carrying the math and at first it helped with one of the direction when 3 of them were moving fast and Up was the only one that was slow) and it may be a Flag issue but I&apos;m just not sure<br><br>any suggestions?<br><br>P.S. I&apos;m also working on the Background as part of this piece and I&apos;m not quite finished with it so a lot of 2&apos;s will show up when complied. <br>
