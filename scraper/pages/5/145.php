If you read $4016 directly from the controller, you&apos;re doing it 100% wrong. Please don&apos;t advocate doing it that way. I&apos;m not going to argue with people again (Main reason I left for so long) how it&apos;s okay to do it how they want. It&apos;s not, it&apos;s the shittiest code you could ever write. Put it into variables, add button press variables, and stop doing it 10000% wrong.</div>
Your example is more correct (start a new thread if you want it ripped apart) for a final product, but far more complicated for an <strong>intro</strong> lesson. &#xA0;Now you need to first explain jsr/rts, variables vs constants vs addresses, <u><em><strong>naming conventions, shifting</strong></em></u>, and bcc. &#xA0;How are those tutorials you were writing going? &#xA0;</div>
<br>
WAAAH!&#xA0; I actually understood what you were talking about until you mentioned those parts I underlined in the quote!&#xA0; I was soooo close!&#xA0; [retreats to corner to sulk].<br>
&#xA0;</div>
It&apos;s not too bad. You&apos;ll be fine. These tutorials are fantastic and guide you through perfectly.<br>
<br>
&#xA0;</div>
Actually, the part that made me laugh is that, unless I&apos;m mistaken, he hasn&apos;t mentioned subroutines yet in the tutorial, yet I have a pretty firm grounding on those.&#xA0; Likewise with variables, constants, addresses...and so on.&#xA0; I was so pleased that I understood things he hadn&apos;t even discussed yet, until I got to the underlined point.&#xA0; :-)<br>
<br>
Either way, yeah, these tutorials are a huge help in understanding the differences needed between simply writing in 6502 and writing in 6502 FOR THE NES.&#xA0; My son and I are working on a game right now and taking the step-by-step approach (step 1; learn 6502, step 2; make our character appear on the screen, step 3; make our character move in some way etc...).&#xA0; So getting my 15 sprite character to pop up and shift left and right was quite exciting for us.&#xA0; Still not quite understanding WHY the code caused it to happen, so we are sticking to the design phase while I work on wrapping my head around it, but these tutorials are being an exciting adventure for us.&#xA0; :-)<br>
<br>
edit:&#xA0; Come to think of it, would it be advisable (and speaking way into the future) to put the movement controls into a subroutine for multi-level games (ala Contra, Super Mario Bros., etc...)?&#xA0; Or can they be left in the main code block?<br>
