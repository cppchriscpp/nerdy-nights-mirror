					I realise that this is an old (if bloody excellent) tutorial, but I wondered what (if any) significance the other 7 bits have, in reading from $4016 each time? Are they just random noise? Seems strange to transmit only one bit of data each time, when the whole controller could be mapped to one byte. Also, if I had a button pressed and let go before that button state was passed to the processor, would there be some lag in value?
