					<p>^^ Beat me to it.</p><p>The STA $2022 should be STA $2023. <br><br>I&apos;d suggest writing out a chart that looks like this: <br>vert, tile, att, horz <br>$2000,$2001,$2002,$2003 <br>$2004,$2005,$2006,$2007...etc. <br><br>That helped me a lot. And when you get multiple sprites, it helps you keep track of which address manipulates which sprite. </p>
