					Made my code longer,aded up and down . That Strangly enough is converted to A and S on my keyboard? Remember is use jnes as emulator because fceuxdsp doesn&apos;t react at all.
<br>
<br>I tried to be smart and changed a and b by left and right(and didn&apos;t changed anything else of that code)4 errors right away,hahaha
