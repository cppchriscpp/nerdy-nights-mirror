	Keep at it Dread, I&apos;m less than 2 months into programming and you can go a long way really fast. I was in the same boat you were just a few weeks ago, and now I have a functional game but it is no where close to done.<br>
	<br>
	Many have helped me along the way. My advice, once you get through the Nerdy Nights and have a working program, go back and read it all again. It&apos;s amazing what you pick up the second, third, and fourth time through.<br>
	<br>
	Also, if you would like, I would can invite you to my private thread that sort of documents my journey of programming my first game. I also try to keep an up-to-date ROM posted in the first post of the private thread so you can see my bugs and play with the game mechanics.</div>
<br>
That would be awesome. I&apos;m having a lot of fun learning, so none of this is a chore. It&apos;s just good fun, challenging and worth every minute.<br>

MRN!!! Dude, thanks. so when I&apos;m coding movement for up and down, what changes do I need to make so the program knows it&apos;s working vertically. I have the left right movement set to the arrow keys and all other buttons have no function.<br>
