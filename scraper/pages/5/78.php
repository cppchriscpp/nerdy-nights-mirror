					Overly complicated tutorials is a common mistake.  By trying to teach everything exactly right the first time the reader will be overloaded and far more likely to fail.  Keeping it simple on purpose, then adding more detail in future lessons keeps the progress moving forward.  Ignore variables until they are brought up in week 7.
