					Thanks zzap,
<br>
<br> changed my asm file and it works.
<br>Even made up and down go right.
<br>
<br> just added 4 up each time 00 04 08 0c this works but i have no idea where these numbers come from i just saw the pattern of left and right.
<br>And figured out i had to do +4. So where do you get the code from?
<br>
<br>Also i assume that the code for controller 2 4017 is the same(except you use $4017)
<br>I dont play pc games so how do you test player 2 controlls btw???????????????
