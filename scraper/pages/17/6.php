					Here are some changes I can think of off the top of my head that would need to be made between the old sound format and the new:<br><br>1) In your song headers, make sure you add a tempo field for each stream<br>2) Make sure you add note lengths into your sound data.&#xA0; For each stream, the very first byte should be a note length.<br><br>Can you send me the song data for your song and sfx (in this thread or in a PM)?&#xA0; Maybe if I see it I can spot the problem.&#xA0; It&apos;s also possible that my code has a bug that I didn&apos;t catch.<br>
