					Hi! I am new to NES developement and I find these tutorials truly valuable.<br>
I am trying to scroll on moving to the right, so I moved the code in the NMI block to the Right button one. However, when I move right, the game screws up and I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing wrong.<br>
<br>
My ASM code:&#xA0;<a href="http://pastebin.com/Zmv0H25A" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/Zmv0H25A</a><br>

Edit: this problem is solved if I move the controller block right before the PPU clean up section, but then the background goes by fits and starts.
