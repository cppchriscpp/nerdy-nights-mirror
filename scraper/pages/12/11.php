<b>This Week:&#xA0;</b>Time to learn how to do <strong><em>horizontal </em></strong>background scrolling</div>
Any chance you wrote something about <strong><em>vertical </em></strong>scrolling?<br>
Since the screen is high only 240px vertically (rather than 256px), it is a bit more messy to find a solution.<br>
<br>
Of course, I can manage a solution, however I was just wondering how you would face the issue.<br>
<br>
Thanks! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
