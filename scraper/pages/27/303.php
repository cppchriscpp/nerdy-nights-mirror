					So using the NN I was able to easily (i.e. with a bit of help, thanks man!) set up my splash, title, and other opening screens. However, I have very slowly switched to MRN&apos;s style of displaying screens and, more importantly, using game states (more or less combining MRN&apos;s tutorials week 2 and week 6). What would be a good way to implement some sort of timer system? Each screen should display for a few seconds, switch to the next, and then ultimately switch game states to something along the lines of LOZ&apos;s file entry screen. If this last screen/state should be part of the preceding state, please speak up.<br>

In my own trials with this problem (it should be pretty easy after all), what is strange is that I can get the splash screen to display for a few seconds and then switch to the next game state; OR I can get the splash to switch to the next screen within the same state (title screen), but it will not switch to the next game state (the screen is off, however, and a white line pulses through it; I&apos;m guessing the the screen is loading and reloading furiously). However, I cannot get both things to work at the same time. I can post code tomorrow, if that helps, but I am away from my code at the moment.
