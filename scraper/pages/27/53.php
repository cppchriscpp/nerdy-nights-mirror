					That about covers what I needed to know, thanks guys. As far as compilers go, if it is good enough to make the Battle Kid games and your various games Khan (anxiously awaiting Study Hall and Unicorn, not to mention The Great Gatsby), it is good enough for me. As for the second question, I was beginning to guess that they were two different things, thanks Roth for helping to clarify and explain both types of programs. The power of the unicorn protects!
