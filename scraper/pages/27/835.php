					Yes! Thank you Neodolphino. That is good to know. I&apos;m really enjoying learning this stuff. Sounds like its working correctly.<br>

Another question... Am I able to use a PAL version of a ROM and burn it to a chip, then soder it to a NTSC board and run it on a NTSC system? The reason I&apos;m asking is because I tried doing this last night and it did not work on my snes. Could have been my terrible sodering though, lol.
