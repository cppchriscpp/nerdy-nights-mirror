	The burai fighters scrolling wouldn&apos;t bee too hard at all. Although, the main thing is, you need to develop the skills of problem solving stuff with arrays and logic as you learn. Looking at that with my experience, it&apos;s not bad at all if you plan it out right the first time. If I saw that when I was starting out, there&apos;d be no way in hell I&apos;d be able to write it in 100 times.</div>

Now I have gotten ahold of NES Burai Fighter on cart, and confirmed that the scrolling definitely is much less complicated than on the Game Boy version. ... Do the differences between the two factor in at all to your answer? Is the Game Boy one still basically as simple of a programming task as the NES one?<br>
<br>
In my dirty readings of Nerdy Nights etc, I thought I read that scrolling involved drawing the background graphics off screen, a full screen area in advance. Can this be done for a diagonal scroll???? Is diagonal scrolling more complicated than horizontal or vertical?<br>
