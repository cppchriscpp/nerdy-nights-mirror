					I have run into an issue and have an idea of how to deal with it but want to find out how other devs have tackled it.  I have the need to capture an input string to perform a special player move.  Think of it like throwing a fireball in street fighter 2 with ryu or ken.  It isn&apos;t that many commands, I just want to do a double direction button push left or right.  
<br>I had the idea to record the previous button presses and then have a timer that the double push needs to be pressed within that time.  Is this on the correct track?  How would you guys go about accomplishing this?
