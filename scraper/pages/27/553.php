					Beau, I was hoping someone a little more knowledgeable here would pipe in with an answer, so I held off replying, but since that apparently isn&apos;t going to happen, I&apos;ll just say that I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible. Sprite 0 hit is just playing tricks with the scrolling, so there isn&apos;t really a way to only turn off half the screen.<br>
<br>
You can do the manual update of tiles with the screen on, but definitely not an entire screen half. I think the tile limit per frame is something like 40? I don&apos;t remember off hand.&#xA0; It also depends on how much else is going on in your game at the time.
