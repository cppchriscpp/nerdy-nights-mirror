Hi Everyone, new here!<br>
<br>
I recently bought a GQ-4X V4 programmer and the ADP-054 16bit add-on. I am attempting to make &quot;The Firemen&quot; for my first repro. I have installed and updated the drivers and software for the GQ. When I start it and nothing is inserted into the Eprom reader, the program says acts like there is already a chip inserted. Is this normal or is my device faulty? I am using m27c801 and have already erased them. Please help!</div>
I think that this thread is more about programming (i.e. coding, writing code) in 6502 assembly, rather than how to program a board writing data on it. Someone else could have the answer you are looking for, but I surely don&apos;t.<br>
<br>
However, since this is your first post: welcome! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span>
