	You don&apos;t need to draw a full screen in advance. You will draw new stuff when required. For example, if you limit the &quot;camera&quot; to move 8 pixels/frame in a single direction, you will need to draw at most one 8 pixel row/column per frame.<br>
	<br>
	Diagonal scrolling is significantly harder to implement than simple horizontal/vertical scrolling. But it also depends on where you cap the scroll speed and other limitations you set. For example, if you never scroll more than 1-2 pixels per frame in a direction and force the scrolling to end on a 8x8 grid (could be usable in an RPG style game, or an overworld map in general), it&apos;s easier to implement than allowing the screen to scroll 16 pixels in either direction on each frame.</div>

Interesting. Thank you for this answer.<br>

... Even though space shooters are a totally pervasive genre of games, I actually feel that the NES is lacking in them, and it seems like a very ripe area for homebrew to me. I know that there are plenty of them on NES, but honestly almost every one of them irritates me. (Lifeforce gives me nightmares.) A lot of them feel very samey and others have colors and imagery that stress me out.  ... Generally the DMG Game Boy versions are much more entertaining for me.<br>
<br>
Burai Fighter really stands out for me as a true original, though it also has many of the colors and graphics that bother me. ... The bizarre scrolling concept seems like a technique that could be elaborated on in a new game with really interesting results.<br>
