					I hate to ask something like this, because I feel like it&apos;s asking too much.  But I&apos;m working on a puzzle game.  I can make a level of it, but then I get stuck.  Is there anyone willing to write out a code to show me, that would do something like this, just so I can see how it is done?
<br>
<br>Just load a background screen and then when a certain button is pressed it loads the next background?
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve gotten stuck here a few times.  Or if there&apos;s a NN that covers this that I missed, could you point me in that direction?
