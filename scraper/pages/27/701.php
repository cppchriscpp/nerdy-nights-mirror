					I&apos;ve had this problem for a while, though it may be normal? All of my sprites are one pixel down vertically, in comparison to the background. Is this normal? They&apos;ve been this way for a couple years, so I don&apos;t know at this point. Finally moving to a grid based system, and it&apos;s bugging me more than it did in the past. And yes, I know that I can just adjust the starting positions of the Y positions (5F instead of 60, for instance), but if it is not normal I&apos;d like to know. Thanks!
