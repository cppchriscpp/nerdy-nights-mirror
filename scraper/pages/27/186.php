					I&apos;m looking at MRN&apos;s Metasprite tutorial right now, and I came up with this little program. However, I made my own random sprite movement routine, and it seems to crash on NEStopia (Mac version), even though it runs fine on Windows XP&apos;s FCEUX<br>
Anyone knows what&apos;s wrong?<br>
