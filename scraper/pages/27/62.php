	99.99999% is windows based. There&apos;s some assemblers and such which should compile on Linux and Mac. I run Linux and have gotten ASM6 to compile quick. But most of the tools with GUI&apos;s (Namtable and graphics editors) are basically Windows only. There&apos;s one IDE, NESICIDE, that has Linux and Windows versions, but I dunno about Mac.</div>

What would be the best NES programming software for Windows? Or at least the best one that you have used? Or what you have heard other people say nice things about?<br>
