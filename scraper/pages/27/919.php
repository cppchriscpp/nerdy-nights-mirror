					That sounds right, especially if that includes updating whatever&apos;s already on screen(?). I&apos;ll try your solution as soon as I can and get back to you if it doesn&apos;t work (or to thank you if it does!)<br>
<br>
Just out of curiosity, would it work to take the code outside of NMI and into the main loop, or is that completely illogical\contradictory?<br>
<br>
<strong>EDIT:</strong> I have tried your solution. While loading one tile at a time isn&apos;t very fast, and working with the variable address will get a little weird for me, it&apos;s nothing I can&apos;t improve\help on my own. Thanks so much! This will help me immensely.
