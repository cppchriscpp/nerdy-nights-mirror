					The common options are:
<br>
<br>1 - make a table of x/y coordinates for a parabola.  When you jump, just follow each step along that table until you hit ground again.
<br>
<br>2 - physics with separate speed and acceleration in x/y.  When you jump, add lots to x acceleration.  Each step subtract a fixed amount from x acceleration.
