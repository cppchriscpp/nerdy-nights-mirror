	A couple of general questions:<br>
	<br>
	1. Regarding compilers, what type of differences exist between each of them. Are they essential differences, or &quot;merely&quot; matters of how one goes about writing code? The reason that I ask is that I read somewhere a while back (cannot recall where) some rather negative remarks about NESASM3 and did not know if learning another compiler would be necessary in the near future. Will NESASM3 get the job done when it comes to making games? I have a feeling that it will, and if it did not have some critics I would be worried (like fifty glowing Amazon reviews for the next piece of exercise equipment), but I thought that I would check. If anyone has continued to use NESASM3 beyond the Nerdy Nights tutorials I would be interested to know. I saw some discussion on NESdev, but it was geared more toward &quot;name your favorite compiler,&quot; and it did not seem to address general or generally specific differences between the different options.</div>
<br>
I still use NESASM3 exclusively, and as far as I know the only differences are how you write things.&#xA0; Of course I am not an expert in this area, so I&apos;ll let someone more knowledgeable chime in.&#xA0; Bunnyboy still updates NESASM3 when bugs are discovered, but as far as I know everything major has been worked out at this point.&#xA0; I&apos;ve never had any problems with it, anyway.<br>

	2. In terms of graphics, what purpose do programs like Tile Layer Pro serve for the homebrewer? Most of the information that I have been able to find about this type of program relates to ROM hacking so even a broad overview would be helpful (or a link to a broad overview). Is this somewhat similar to the map editor that Sivak wrote for his games, or that Maiu posted a while back for Project P (<br clear="all"><div class="col-md-6"><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/DjYeB604a1s?list=UUGNm2vGRTPwbO0Q6u-X7MuA">Youtube</a></div></div><br clear="all">)? It would appear that at least the latter programs would alleviate some of the need for coding each individual tile of the background (not trying to bypass that essential skill, but just looking ahead).<br>
	<br>
	Thanks in advance!</div>
I only use Tile Layer Pro for drawing tiles, creating the .chr file that I .include in my assembly files.&#xA0; I don&apos;t know of its potential to actually create map data (and honestly, I had no idea that Project P existed until you just posted that.&#xA0; It looks amazing!)&#xA0; I&apos;ve personally use&#xA0;(and I know a few other homebrewers that also use) nesst for my games, which doesn&apos;t have the drag and drop feature that Project P has, but it still works very well for what I need.<br>
<br>
Hopefully some more developers will jump in here and answer from their perspectives.&#xA0; They may know of features/tools that I haven&apos;t used.<br>
