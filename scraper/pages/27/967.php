					Thank you guys for the help, before I put the engine into the forever loop, just want to double check I&apos;ve done everything else correctly, also trying to single out what of my engine I need to put inside the forever loop, basically everything from 182 to 293? or would I include all the sub routines?

Also, here&apos;s what I got when I tried the above code w/ sleeping, did I need to define this somewhere else? feel like im missing something obvious lol, attached is my error log&#xA0;
