So if I am understanding this correctly, these are all preloaded? I have been associating them more as individually defined (such as variables in modern languages i.e. int something )<br>
<br>
If thats true, it makes it a lot easier to grasp. Is there a place i can go for a list? My current sources never even mention them, and admittedly, the only harDcopy i have is copywrite 1980 :-/. Also, are these NES specific, or otherwise limited in use?<br>
<br>
P.s. your answer was seriously exciting. Every step forward is renewed vigor. :-)</div>
<br>
All of the directives are preloaded in the sense that NESASM understands them innately, just like any command like LDA/STA.&#xA0; The data they control will be different all the time, obviously, but they&apos;re used in the same sort of context every time.<br>
<br>
I unfortunately don&apos;t know of any list.&#xA0; I just stick to what I know.&#xA0; And I&apos;m sure they will work with any assembly code, although they may be called something slightly different.&#xA0; NES is the only thing I know how to code for, sadly.<br>
<br>

Either way, it&apos;s a huge help, and a confidence booster.&#xA0; Thanks a lot.
