One important thing to remember about MMC3 is to not assign the same PPU CHR page for sprites and BG tiles. I.e. one page should be used for BG tiles only, other for sprites only, either in 8x8 or 8x16 mode. Otherwise IRQs just won&apos;t work.</div>

Don&apos;t think I understand what you mean by PPU CHR page... However this might be the solution.
