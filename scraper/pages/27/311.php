		I would save the rom with a tiny minor pixel change in Tile Layer Pro and that would also affect the zapper functionality.&#xA0;</div>
	Maybe the emulator is doing a crc check to enable the zapper, so when you make any change it turns the zapper off?<br>

<i>Yeah, that ended up being the issue! I had tried changing the input port 1 to zapper but it was port 2 I needed to use. Everything works fine now! Thanks!</i><br>
