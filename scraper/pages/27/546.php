	So all of the types of games we&apos;ve all been making deal with the background in the same type of way.&#xA0; Either we load a static background image and then either replace indivial/a series of tiles as things occur, or we scroll the background to load more backgrounds, but they&apos;re always mostly static images.<br>
	<br>
	How are racing/flying games like Rad Racer or F15 City War done? I haven&apos;t seen any programming techniques using these methods explained, and I&apos;d really love to learn more about how its done.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks.</div>
