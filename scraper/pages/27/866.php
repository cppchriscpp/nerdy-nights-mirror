					Yes, if you just need to make an aimed shot, all you need is two more tables, sin/cos scaled to the projectile speed. Normally that would be two 256-byte tables generated with a script that is basically the simplest circle drawing code I reffered above, and you just use the output A as index in these tables to get dx,dy from them.
