					Kevin, thanks for the response and no worries.

<br>I&apos;m assuming that the support just isn&apos;t there yet for nesasm. I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s just a matter of time before someone adds it, maybe I will if/when I have some time... for now, I&apos;m just using ca65 / nintendulator which has the symbol debugging I was looking for.
