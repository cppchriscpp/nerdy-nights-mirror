					Thanks to everyone here and their help I have my character animating left and right, ducking and using a special skill.  My next question is more of an opinion.  On the subject of jumping I have a question.  I know when programming more modern games usually when a player jumps it is the physics engine that brings it back down, mostly the gravity.  For nes do you guys implement a &apos;gravity&apos; to keep all characters grounded or do you just use the character attributes for bringing it back down?  I&apos;m sure everyone has their own opinion and I guess I am just looking for that.  What is your opinion on tackling this for a newbie like myself?
