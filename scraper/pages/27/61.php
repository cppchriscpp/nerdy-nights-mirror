					The NESASM and ASM6 assemblers are easily compiled for MacOS so you can make games, but right now the best greaphics tools and debuggers are Windows only. Hopefully NESICIDE will get more stable because it really is meant to be cross platform. I primarily use Xcode-&gt;NESASM-&gt;Nestopia, then drop into Parallels/XP to use FCEUX for debugging when needed. A separate box would be too much hassle.
