&quot;Hope this helps.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep, great, thanks.<br>
<br>
I figured out few things reasoning by myself (see also my edit of the post above about the sprites displayed on a specific scan line limits), but it is useful to get confirmation from someone with more experience. And some other points you make are really enlightening on the subject, add some more knowledge, and are really clear to understand. Nice to know.<br>
<br>
Thanks again, appreciated.<br>
<br>
&quot;The game I am making...&quot;<br>
Good luck (or whatever wish fits the best) with it, of course!<br>
