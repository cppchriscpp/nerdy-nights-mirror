					Hi! I wanted to make a 32 x 16 Sprite Move by pushing the Left and right buttons, but when i load and save sprite positions more than 4, It makes the sprite move right very quickly, it&apos;s probably some kind of limitation, but i&apos;m not sure which to expand the numbers.
<br>Here&apos;s a screenshot on what i&apos;ve done on the screen. (which is edited in Nerdy Nights Week 6.)
