	Thanks for the advice guys, I just need to suck it up and get it done. Like Derek said, this is probably going to be an incremental thing, so get my first game done and learn and optimise from there. I like that plan<br>

	And MRN: I was more thinking of the NesDev forums when I said that than here, your programming resources thread is fucking awesome</div>

That&apos;s a great attitude. Start with something of reasonable scope, too. Most successful homebrewers I&apos;ve met start small, finish their projects and then increase complexity from there.&#xA0;<br>
