					-Is it possible in theory to have those HDMI NES consoles support the Zapper flawlessly but just too complicated/expensive or  does the technology not exist at all?
<br>
<br>-Is there any way to build in some kind of recording device in GB/GBC/GBA consoles enabling it to capture gameplay footage?
<br>
<br>-Could an Original GB console be modified to run on it&apos;s yellowish graphics but without the ghosting effect taking place when things move &quot;fast&quot;?
