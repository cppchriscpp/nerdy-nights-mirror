					I&apos;m having a strange issue regarding controller input. Recently, I tried redoing my controller reading code to match the one in the Nerdy Nights subroutines tutorial. For the most part, it works as it should, but every time I press left the game crashes. Nothing I change in my code makes a difference and I have no clue what could be causing it, as it for some reason only does this when I press left. Any ideas?
