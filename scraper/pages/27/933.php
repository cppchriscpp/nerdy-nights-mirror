Ok, so, you inverted two lines in your code and now it works?<br>
Try now to make the longest variable name shorter, and make sure to use only ASCII letters (a-z) chars defining such name, and see what happens if you bring it back where it was, or other stuff like that.<br>
<br>
I sincerely doubt that the issue is truly here, but since you say so, I will believe it. However, like I said, I do not use NESASM, so sorry about that, I am not the best subject to help you out here, since it seems a question NESASM related. If you have any question about assembly coding for the NES more in general, it is a bit more likely that I can have a more useful answer to provide you.<br>
<br>
Cheers.
