					Yea, what&apos;s really a bitch is when you&apos;re swapping the entire set of PRG memory, including the fixed bank.  For example, MMC1 can handle up to 2 sets of 256KB.  When you swap 256KB banks, it&apos;s like jumping to a completely different program.  You pretty much have to do like Memblers said while making sure you jump back and forth to the right place.  
<br>
<br>However, writing a program this large is not something you&apos;ll likely run into.
