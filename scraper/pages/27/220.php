	Moving forward and not understanding is why you don&apos;t get it. Just gonna point out a logical error too: You don&apos;t disable the PPU then not enable it. You have to enable it (Or at MINIMUM NMI&apos;s) forit to be enabled. Your NMI might cause glitches if you don&apos;t remember, it can and does happen. Disabling, then having an NMI happen when &quot;off&quot; in the middle of doing stuff will lead to nasty bugs.</div>
<br>
I don&apos;t think it will be a problem because nothing really happens between that code and the NMI. I was enabling the PPU right after the LoadBackground and it was wigging out my screen. Since going this route, my screen issues have fixed. If it breaks future code, then I guess I will be forced to cross that bridge when it happens. The NMI is still and enigma to me, so any advice helps!<br>
