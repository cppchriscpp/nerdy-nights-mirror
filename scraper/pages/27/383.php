Maybe??<br>

I&apos;m trying to back up and not miss anything this time around. Back in January I asked way too complicated of a question, and really did not understand a lot of necessary things. It is funny, sprites are one of the easiest things to get moving around on the screen, which leads to the illusion that I understand them, only to realize that I have no clue. At the moment I just want to figure out how to load/update them. Perhaps loading and updating are the same, maybe not; I&apos;m not even sure on that anymore. We all seem to use the terminology differently, and it gets to be a bit confusing. Room indexing, meta-sprites, and all of that other stuff can wait until later.<br>
<br>
<u>Super Edit</u>: After ripping apart MRN&apos;s code (down to 22 lines&#xA0;to get one sprite up, bit more to get it moving)&#xA0;I think that I&apos;ve got it! I&apos;ll share what I&apos;ve&#xA0;come to realize when I get things fully figured out (it could be a while).&#xA0;However, if you have thoughts or advice on the subject feel free to share it as I slowly rebuild things.<br>
