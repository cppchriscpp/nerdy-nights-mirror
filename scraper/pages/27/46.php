					Sorry. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_tongue"></span>
<br>
<br>I have a question. Is it common to interpret a value as a 2&apos;s complement signed number,
<br>and use the negative values for left movement and positive values for right movement?
<br>Could you then get away with just adding a value to the sprite&apos;s X value every time you move?
<br>You know, instead of having to branch and subtract if you want to move left?
<br>If this is a good idea, some example code would be appreciated. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
<br>
<br>An example or explanation of sub-pixel movement would also be nice.
<br>
<br>I hope I&apos;m making sense, thanks!
