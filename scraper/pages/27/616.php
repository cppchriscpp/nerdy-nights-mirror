					I managed to figure out how to use the assemblers after some digging, thanks though for the heads up Bunnyboy.<br>

As for the nerdy nights tutorials they do lay it all out for you. The problem I am having is I don&apos;t know where to start. I follow along and type the example code out in the order it is given and then as I am trying to understand the reasoning behind it but it just doesn&apos;t make sense besides that first bit of code at the beginning of every game and the banks (sort of). Either way I feel that with no coding know how something like this is just too big and complex. I am going to at least give it a couple of weeks of reading the tutorials and typing the code and hoping i manage to pick up some of the logic behind it. Who knows maybe it will magically click in my head but in all honestly computer language is complex an with out schooling or understanding of the basics its going to be rough. I am going to try and devote an hour or two each day to those tutorials and see where it takes me. Anyhow wish me luck, ill post an update or something maybe after a week or so messing with this stuff.<br>

Maybe there is a book or something with step by step instruction of making a stupid simple game. I gather once I understand how it fits together and the math of the whole thing it&apos;d be easier to explore and learn more complex coding. I&apos;ll keep an eye out on the interwebs too.
