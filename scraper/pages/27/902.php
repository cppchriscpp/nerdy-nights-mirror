					If the seconds ball does not move before collision, it shouldn&apos;t be too hard, given ROM space enough for lookup tables.<br>
I am rather busy, else it would be a nice exercise to do in assembly.<br>
Really I think is all about speed, angle, x offset, y offset; generating a new couple of speed and angle values for the second ball.<br>
With lookup tables and a spread sheet (or script) to generate them, it should be reasonably easy.<br>

Edit: correction.
