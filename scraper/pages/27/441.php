					There&apos;s something I&apos;ve had a hard time wrapping my head around for longer than I want to admit now, and It&apos;s starting to get embarassing, so I&apos;ll just see if I can get it together myself with some helpful hints(hopefully) from you guys.<br>
<br>
So, first of all; how do you keep an 8.8(signed) variable between -n and n(e.g. -$02.$80 and $02.$80), and how could you increment/decrement the value of this 8.8 fixed-point number by x(8-bit number)?<br>
<br>
Thanks, and sorry for awkward English. :S
