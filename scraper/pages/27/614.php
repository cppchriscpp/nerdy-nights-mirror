I think this is all beyond me. All it does is makes my head hurt, lol. I am going to keep at it for a couple of days and see if i pick anything up. Though at this point it just appears as math and gibberish to me. I mostly did graphical editing, its my one and only computer talent.&#xA0;</div>
Relax. There is a lot of math gibberish to digest of course, but programming a game for a NES has some advantages.<br>
<br>
First, the machine &quot;knows&quot; what you are doing: a game. Knows there are sprite, a background, a screen that must be refreshed every 1/60th of a second, and such.<br>
<br>
You just have to learn how to communicate with your code the positions of the sprites, the tiles composing the background, where to jump at each screen refresh.<br>
<br>
If you ask me, nerdy nights is an excellent starting point.<br>
<br>
If doing it in assembly is too unfriedly to you, try the <em>Shiru </em>&quot;C way&quot; proposed and linked above by <em>glutock</em>.<br>
<br>
In any case, especially since you seem to have a really little familiarity with programming in general, this process will take you some learning time, way over a couple of days. Give yourself at least three weeks of study in your free time to understand the minimal basics, and at least another month to publish your first hyper simple mini game.<br>
<br>
Also, if starting from assembly is hard, try understanding the logic behind &quot;higher level&quot; programming languages (e.g. python, or even basic): instructions such as if, else, loop, and so on. Then you will understand that in assembly you don&apos;t have an &quot;if...(something)&quot; instruction, you have a &quot;branch if...(something)&quot; instruction instead.<br>
<br>
Take it easy, step by step, and keep your first goals minimal: being able to position a specific sprite where you intended to, is already an important achievment for a beginner.<br>
<br>
It was at least for me a year and half ago, when I started learning assembly, not being a programmer in the academic way too. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>

<strong>Edit</strong>: a couple of misspelling.
