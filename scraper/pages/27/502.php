1. The one lower down will be drawn on top. i.e. 0 on top of 1, 4 on top of 10, and 62 on top of 63, and so on.<br>
<br>
2. Bit %00X00000 of the sprite attributes specifies on top/behind bg. 0 is in front, 1 is behind.<br>
<br>
3. If I understand your question, the transparent color is always transparent when rendering sprites. Otherwise you&apos;d have a square running around all the time.<br>
<br>
Beat me to it with a better answer!
