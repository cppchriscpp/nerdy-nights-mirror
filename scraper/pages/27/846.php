					I&apos;m working through some of the tutorials here and, while it&apos;s very slow, I&apos;m starting to understand the basics. Spent all day today working on getting a game state/screen loading routine worked out for a pong game. Something strange happens that has me scratching my head. I&apos;ll be removing the jump code in the end but keeping it in for now. It works as written unless the player2 (right) paddle is at it&apos;s lowest point. Then the jump rises as intended but falls slowly and continues to fall ad infinitum. I can&apos;t see any reason for this strange behavior. Code (not well commented) and rom are attached. Can someone help me figure out what the hell is going on?  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ordfbm6mrejem6p/robo-pong.zip?dl=0" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/ordfbm6...</a>
