					It is possible to detect older or current emulators, but just as you use such detection, emulators will eventually consider your trick and it&apos;ll stop to work. Not to mention that all your tricky detection code could be disabled by a romhacker in minutes.<br>

One of ways is to check initial RAM/VRAM contents. Emulators clear it out on start up, but it is never clear on actual hardware, and has semi-random data pattern instead.
