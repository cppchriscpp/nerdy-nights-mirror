					So, I was doing some research of general 6502 programming and it looks like the accepted standard way for &apos;less than &amp; greater than\equal to&apos; is BCC and BCS. BMI and BPL can do the same thing in a compare situation, however, it may be slow. I think I am seeing this issue when writing text to the sceen using BMI. I am going to replace BMI with BCC and see if it improves it.
