					Assembly question:
<br>If I use indirect addressing mode with a register, and the resulting address would overflow, what would happen?
<br>Like:
<br>$00 = #$F0
<br>$01 = #$06
<br>x = #$20
<br>Would LDA [$00], x return $0710 or $0610?
<br>
<br>I&apos;m new to this. Sorry if the question doesn&apos;t make sense.
