					If you use CHR RAM, you will always have to put something there with your code. Otherwise you&apos;ll have random garbage instead of graphics (on the hardware), or blank tileset (in emulators). PPU does not do anything automatically, it does not even know any difference between CHR ROM, CHR RAM, or lack of ROM/RAM (you can even wire it up so it&apos;ll use its own nametable RAM). PPU does not automatically put anything into CHR ROM, it is basic feature of the ROM itself, to keep preprogrammed information. ROM is not programmable by PPU/CPU, it is only programmed during manufacturing process.
