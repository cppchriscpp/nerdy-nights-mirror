					But what do you DO with the result. Do you use it in a table to look up what to add to the projectile Y and X (Kalle seems to be indicating that, I think?)? That&apos;s the part that I&apos;m unclear on. That link is going to take some digesting, but I&apos;m kind of stuck at the conceptual level for the moment.
