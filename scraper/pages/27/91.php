					One question that has been eluding me for a while has been the practical difference between CHR RAM and CHR ROM. I have read through the NESDEV material on the subject, and also several threads, but no one seems to be too interested in breaking down the differences in practical terms, i.e. how they actually affect game design and for which types of games each is best suited. Instead the material seems to focus more on the exceptions to the rule and fancy technical effects (which are interesting, but way down the line for me). I understand that one&apos;s choice can be made for them through the choice of a mapper, but in the case of the MMC1 both options exist (looking at INL&apos;s flashable options). So, for those who have done some programming, what has your experience been? What influenced your decision, and what benefits/limitations came with your choice? Also, if you have any recommendations for someone looking to do an overhead adventure game with a lot of tile data, I would be curious to know your thoughts on this as well <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
<br>
<br>Lastly, when choosing a flashable board for testing purposes, is it all right to have too high of specs? Would the best bet for development be to get the largest board possible, or will this cause complications? The answer may be obvious, but I thought that I would check before purchasing (assuming that I can make a decision on the CHR RAM/ROM issue).
<br>
<br>Thanks for any and all help!
