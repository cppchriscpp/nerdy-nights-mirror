					Bunnyboy did a tutorial on scrolling and the sprite 0 stuff.  It&apos;s in Roth&apos;s organization thread.

<br>IIRC, to handle the four score, you just read the controller 1 and 2 ports a second time...so you&apos;d read them like 1, 2, 1, 2 and store the data you get in the controller variables for 1, 2, 3, 4.  Then the controller variables run just like the others.  Been a while since I messed with this though.
