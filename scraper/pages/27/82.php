					So I managed to fool around with some code and get NESASM to spit out a file that my NES emulator can run, which was super exciting.
<br>
<br>So, eventually I might actually get a game together, and I might want to put it on a cart, even a repro one.
<br>
<br>1) Is this possible using the code I write for NESASM and/or the file NESASM produces?
<br>
<br>2) If so, how do I actually get my game from my computer to the cart?
