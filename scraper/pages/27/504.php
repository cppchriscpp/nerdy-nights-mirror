					This is something that has always given me trouble (along with sprites in general), but what would be some different ways to program autonomous sprite movement? I understand getting something to move through player input, or even if it is hard coded from the get go (as in the ball in Pong), but what if one wants more control? Just to keep things simple, say when the A button is pressed, the player sprite walks several steps and then stops. At the moment, all I can get him to do is jump to a new location. Any help would be great!
