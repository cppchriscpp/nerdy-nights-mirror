					So I&apos;ve decided to take the big leap and give home brewing a go. I have very limited programming knowledge. So for the past 24 years that I&apos;ve owned a computer at most I&apos;ve learned how to do simple modifications to games. I&apos;ve managed to learn enough to make my own hack of one of my favorite NES games but even then I had tools designed to aid in creating a hack for said game. So lets just say I know very little about programming. I would like to begin with the nerdy nights tutorials and go from there.&#xA0;<br>
<br>
::EDIT::<br>
I honestly dont even know where to start. I am googling infomation but many of the links for programs are dead.<br>
<br>
::ANOTHER EDIT::<br>
Alright, I wanted to use&#xA0;NESASM3 but I can&apos;t seem to open it.&#xA0;
