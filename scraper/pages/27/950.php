					Thanks for the opinions guys.  For my learning I went with gravity but that may change.  I have my character doing what I want for now.  The next thing I want to learn is character interaction with obstacles.  In my demo I am using to learn the type is a platformer but I guess it doesn&apos;t really matter.  I am trying to learn how to make the player land on platforms and be impeded by obstacles.  Im going to start with random platforms that the character can jump to.  My first thought is that we put some sprites on the screen to create the platforms.  Now when this is finished how do I check to see if the player is standing on them?  I mean my first thought would be when the player is moving down, to chek to see if the players Y value is greater than or equal to the &apos;platforms&apos;.  I currently do this in my demo but the y value is uniform forming an invisible floor that the player could move along while I tested everything else.  With many sprites at different heights it seems like that would be a lot of tests each frame.  Is there an easier way?  Like a general sprite collision routine and then figure out what it is interacting with (enemy, wall, floor etc.)
