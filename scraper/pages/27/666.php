So if I am understanding this correctly, these are all preloaded? I have been associating them more as individually defined (such as variables in modern languages i.e. int something )<br>
<br>
If thats true, it makes it a lot easier to grasp. Is there a place i can go for a list? My current sources never even mention them, and admittedly, the only harDcopy i have is copywrite 1980 :-/. Also, are these NES specific, or otherwise limited in use?<br>
<br>
P.s. your answer was seriously exciting. Every step forward is renewed vigor. :-)</div>

Assembler directives are assembler specific(not CPU specific), tho there are usually a set of directives most assemblers have.<br>
A directive tells the <u>assembler</u> to do something like &quot;define constant value in ROM at this location&quot;(nothing done in CPU, just a value in the ROM memory somewhere that you can access) or &quot;start assembling from this address&quot;.<br>
An opcode tells the <u>CPU</u> to do something, like &quot;add value to accumulator&quot;.<br>
<br>
Edit: A variable in a modern language is stored in RAM, it&apos;s the same here. Just a value that you can read/write to.<br>
