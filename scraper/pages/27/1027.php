					Yeah, Tetris confounded me for the longest time when starting out. I just couldn&apos;t figure out how it was being done, and then I couldn&apos;t figure out how to do it programming-wise. The whole idea of sprites becoming background objects for a while, or vice versa, baffled me. Now I enjoy it and use it a lot. A nice clean way of cheating those scan line restrictions, palette restrictions, and some other stuff probably too.
