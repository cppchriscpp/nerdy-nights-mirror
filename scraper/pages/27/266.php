					You need to take the button they check for on that part of the engine and change it. Start by working back from controller readying with $4016 and $4017, and see where they store the variables. Then find the one they use in the engine, and just fiddle with them and see which action each check handles. Then, change the button they check for from the L/R buttons to A/B. Anything more than that needed help/explaination, might as well be asking us to do it for you honestly. Not that there is anything wrong, just don&apos;t expect results tbh.
