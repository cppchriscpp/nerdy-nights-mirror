					Is this the right place to ask about how to make a dmc file?  I&apos;ve found various code and tutorials on their use, but not their creation! I know famitracker can convert instruments, but those are all fti, right?... I found a huge repository of dmc files, but I&apos;d still like to be able to produce my own.
