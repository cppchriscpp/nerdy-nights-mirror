					You will forgive my ignorance, two hours ago I was not even aware of the existence of .nsf files.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been asking to use, as a soundtrack in a game we are developing, some music a composer composed in .nsf format. After understanding I could open the file in FcEux, it was obvious to me that in no way this could be done directly converting the data in the file in the &quot;language&quot; of the game sound engine (atm just a simplified version of MetalSlime NN sound engine, which is planned to be enhanced if needed in order to handle this music complexity).
<br>
<br>So my questions are:
<br>
<br>- is there a tool which allows me to graphically see the &quot;music-sheet&quot; (pitches, volume and lengths would be a start) of square1, square2, triangle, and noise channels parameters, of a specific track in that .nsf file? (I tried Famitracker, after downloading it, but it seems not even able to play the .nsf format music); or
<br>
<br>- is there a tool able to convert a specific .nsf track to midi format of four channels? (so I can open it in a midi editor to see the &quot;music-sheet&quot; of each channel and rewrite the music for the game music engine? I think this one is really unlikely to be true); or
<br>
<br>- is there another solution you would suggest?
<br>
<br>Thanks to anybody can help. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
