Lol I thought of that before you edited it to this.<br>

If you set up your game to have some kind of object/entity/actor system, and you have a routine that just iterates over all of those and draws their meta sprites to the screen, you can embed logic in there so it&apos;s easier to think about...it&apos;ll take care of the Y+1 thing for you and then you can just say &quot;draw this at Y = 10&quot; and it actually will be at 10, but your underlying routines will put it at 9 in the actual oam.<br>
