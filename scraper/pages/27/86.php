	Hey guys,<br>
	<br>
	I&apos;m starting to make repros of particular roms for snes. I&apos;m looking to complete dragon quest 1,2,3,5,6 as well as chrono trigger crimson echoes, terranigma and others ! From what research I have conducted I realize most these games will esquire different EPROMs 32,36,40,44 pin chips. Can someone point me in the direction of a cheap programmer that will do most of these chips with minimal of adapters being purchased. Also If someone could point me in the direction of the software needed to remove the headers,checksum, pan out a file to a larger size or anything else anyone may know about putting roms on existing carts.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks in advance for any responses</div>
I think you are a bit confused about what this thread is for.&#xA0;<br>
<br>
It is about programming homebrew games for the NES, not making reproductions. &#xA0;There are lots of good resources out there, try searching around.<br>
