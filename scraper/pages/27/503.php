	A transparent sprite pixel does not get drawn. &#xA0;But a pixel using the same color index (black) not in the transparent slot (first slot) will get drawn. &#xA0;So in your example if the sprite uses the first black (transparent) the picture will be red (background), and if it uses the second black (actually black) the picture will be black (sprite). &#xA0;This should probably have a cool sample image here... &#xA0;The slot is the important part, not the color itself. &#xA0;Hope that makes sense in English too &#xA0;</div>
Yes, #3 you got my question right, I don&apos;t know if makes sense in English, but makes sense to me <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_wink"></span><br>
