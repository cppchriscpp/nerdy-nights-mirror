					The great thing about code is there is more than 1 right answer. Some strive for the smallest and quickest solution. Some strive for the cleanest looking code so its easy to follow. Others just make it work.

<br>Personally, I would go the route of MRN on how to hide sprites just because for me, its the simplest to follow. I&apos;m not too worried about CPU and space at this time because my programs are not very big or labor intensive.
