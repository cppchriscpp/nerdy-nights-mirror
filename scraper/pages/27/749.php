WAY off topic but is there a rom of the game centipede for the nes? I love the Atari version and was curious to know if anyone ever ported it to nes or made their own version, thanks! Also stoked for The legends of Owlia!</div>

Well, there&apos;s Millipede by HAL, which is just like Centipede but better<br>
