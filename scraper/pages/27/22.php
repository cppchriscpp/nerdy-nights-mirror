					Sorry to flood your thread with super general noob questions KHAN games. It was a new thread with a sticky on it and it said &quot;no matter how ridiculous&quot; and &quot;without fear of mocking&quot;, so...
<br>
<br>Sniglet actually asked a question or two for which your answers were very illuminating for me, (I looked up &quot;mappers&quot;, which is not something that relates to the Vectrex assembly programming I have been trying to learn about).
<br>
<br>... I think if I had a very specific question with a project of my own, I would probably start my own thread, rather than getting lost in another one. Wouldn&apos;t specific questions about one&apos;s own active project warrant that???
<br>
<br>So the answers to my own super general questions here were very welcome, and I am glad you made this thread! 
<br>
<br>... I did subsequently view the &quot;Nerdy Nights&quot; weekly tutorials, which are also linked from a sticky thread, though. Probably that is the most appropriate place for people to start. It looks like a very well organized introduction.
