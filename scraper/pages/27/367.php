					This thread is about programming original games, which is 100% legal. &quot;Programming&quot; an ee-prom (remakes of Mario, Castlevania as per your example) is not the same thing as &quot;programming&quot; a new homebrew game. I can&apos;t personally comment on the legality of repros because I do not make them nor collect them.
