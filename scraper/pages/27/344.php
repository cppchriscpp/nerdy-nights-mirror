	So you&apos;d just copy them in one frame and reverse them in the next.<br>
	<br>
	set a variable<br>
	if it is 0, straight copy, 1, reverse copy.<br>
	<br>
	i.e. sprite 0 would go to 0<br>
	1 to 1<br>
	etc.<br>
	63 to 63 in regular order<br>
	<br>
	i.e. sprite 63 would be copied to 0<br>
	62 to 1,<br>
	61 to 2<br>
	etc.<br>
	0 to 63 in the reverse order</div>
<br>
I understand what you&apos;re trying to do, but can you show me a code example of how to do it?<br>
