					Yea, I&apos;m on my forth iteration of the nightman code.  The first two attempts I honestly have no clue how the room selection worked.  I had a professor in college that used to put ? marks everywhere and write &quot;compensating errors&quot;.  I just stopped messing with it when it worked.  Then, like Bunny said, there&apos;s no way to use it when you make another game.  The third iteration was pretty good, but it included separate engines for the levels and background, bad guys and playable characters.  Basically, doubling the code required.  This fourth iteration I have a better idea of what I&apos;m doing and it&apos;s pretty fucking sleek.  Adding new shit is as simple as copy/paste &amp; update pointer tables.  It all just depends on what you&apos;re going for.
