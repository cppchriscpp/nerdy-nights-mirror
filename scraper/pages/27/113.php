					Hello all.
<br>
<br>I have a small? request for help on a mini project of mine. I don&apos;t want to post any specifics because it will be part of something larger later on. Whoever helps I will make sure is credited for their work.
<br>
<br>Basically I have dumped 3 chips off a NES cart, the PRG, CHR and a 3rd chip which I believe to possibly be some sort of patch/modification to the original code. I have verified the dumps and I have been able to get the main code to run in an emulator. I have skimmed the 3rd chip but I am stuck as to what it actually changes/what it&apos;s purpose really is. 
<br>
<br>If you think you could help me, please send me a PM and we will go from there. If any of the programming gods want to have a go, I would really appreciate it.
<br>BTW due to the nature of the content (which really could turn out to be nothing special) I would like to try and work with someone who has a good rep, nothing to do with skills, more on the whole keeping it between myself and the other person.
<br>
<br>Wish I could be more clear, but if you want to help, please send me a PM. I know some of you don&apos;t do PM&apos;s (I&apos;m looking at you Bunny) and you want to help, just post here and I can contact you via email or whatever your preferred communication method is.
<br>I am from Australia so bear with me in terms of the time difference. I am in no hurry though.
<br>
<br>Thanks!
