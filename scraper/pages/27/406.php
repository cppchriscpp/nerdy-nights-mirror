	Between C and C++, which is considered the best for writing/improving 8-bit or 16-bit emulators? &#xA0;Examples of said emulators would be much appreciated.</div>
<br>
Nobody (that I&apos;m aware of that posts regularly) has written an emulator here at Nintendoage. That question might gain some traction on the NESDev forums, as they have a very active emulator sub-forum.<br>
<br>
In my humble opinion, the language doesn&apos;t really matter, the improvements made to currently maintained emulators have mostly come from finally understanding the inner workings of the hardware.
