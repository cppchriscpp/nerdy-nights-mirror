					Mapper does not matter here. It only depends on what you have on the cartridge board on the PPU bus - ROM or RAM. If your board uses ROM for CHR (normal for NROM and most other boards), you won&apos;t be able to rewrite its contents, and if your board uses RAM for CHR, you will always have to rewrite it.
