					I&apos;m working on this other experimental project too, the car racing game (Super Sprint like or Super Off Road like) I was talking about few posts above, and I have three quick questions:<br>
<br>
1. Scrolling<br>
I got advice here to start from an easy horizontal scrolling, so I decided to have long shaped tracks rather than squared shaped tracks. I mean, fi, to have tracks 1x4 screen rather than 2x2 screens. I know there is a nice page on nesdev wiki (IIRC) on how to do horizontal scrolling correctly, but I can&apos;t find it. Anyone can help?<br>
<br>
2. Sprite 0 collision<br>
What is that exactly? Is there a page explaining it deeply?<br>
If so please point it out, I can&apos;t find anything except vague references to it.<br>
<br>
3. Nes Four Score<br>
Is there a good page on what to do if I want the game to support the NES four score?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance to anyone can help. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
