	Forgive me for jumping so far ahead...I make too many assumptions. <strong>Maybe someday I will better understand how to teach!</strong></div>

I&apos;m the new one here, but for what my opinion is worth, I think that you effort was an extremely welcome reply, and I&apos;m confident that your snippet of code and your comments helped out, were fully understandable, and were definitely useful to the member you were replying to. Moreover, I think that when posting a &quot;solution&quot; on a thread &quot;stackoverflow.com-like&quot;, like this one is, it is not really about &quot;only&quot; give a possible solution to the one person asking, is more about giving an answer to anyone reading the thread, maybe having the same issue but not brave enough to ask. Just my &quot;personal opinion&quot; two cents.
