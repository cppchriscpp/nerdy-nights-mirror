					Sorry, I was just nitpicking. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_wink"></span>
<br>I meant, the sprites aren&apos;t actually changed when you change the sprite RAM.
<br>But it is easy as changing it anytime you want, since you can just DMA one RAM page to the sprite OAM.
<br>
<br>Or am I wrong here?
