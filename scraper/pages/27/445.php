OCD. The real kind.<br>
Thanks for the code, I&apos;ll go through it with pen and paper so I understand all of it. If I can&apos;t get<br>
the basics of handling numbers down, I might as well just go back to make shit in Java and C++ for PC.<br>
I have no intention of doing that tho. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_tongue"></span><br>

Again, thanks a lot!<br>
