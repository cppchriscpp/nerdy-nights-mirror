					Ypu can do them as bg tiles or sprites. Usually, if they are sprites its because there is special animation or just numbers for a score, like in Jackal. I normally use background tiles. When you get further along and look up using ram buffers to save on nmi time, this way you can write a good number of tiles to the bg.
