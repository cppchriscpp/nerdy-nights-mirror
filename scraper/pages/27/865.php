	Well, you do with it whatever you want to do, who knows that better than you?<br>

Hahaha, well played sir <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span>. I don&apos;t tend to use a lot of code from around the internet, so I am not always great at integrating it succesfully. I can usually make it work with enough patience, but in this case I didn&apos;t want to set about re-inventing the wheel if there was a standard way of doing things for aiming a shot, for instance. Thanks for the suggestions about how to do things; I think that that might be what I am after. More tables it seems, in order to get the Y and X rates of movement.<br>
