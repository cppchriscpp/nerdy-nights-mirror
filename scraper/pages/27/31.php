					Khan and MRN, thank you very much for this.
<br>
<br>KHAN - The script will be very helpful, I&apos;m sure.  I can&apos;t wait to implement it.  What does dw stand for?  I&apos;ve only ever seen .db before.
<br>
<br>MRN - Thank you as well.  I think that was what was screwing me up...I kept trying to just re-load images, as opposed to initialize the ram, and doing everything over from the start.
