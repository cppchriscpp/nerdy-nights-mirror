	Forgive me for jumping so far ahead...I make too many assumptions. Maybe someday I will better understand how to teach!</div>

Shoot Derek, I just saw this. Your comments were definitely useful, and have gotten me thinking about different ways to handle sprites all around and in a bigger sense. I am quite excited to dig into them more, but need to take a few smaller steps first <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>. Plenty of questions will be sent your way once I really begin to work with them, but for now I just needed help with using movements in one small feature (that will likely have to be redone in the end, but at least it is working now!).<br>

Oh, and&#xA0;there are no better&#xA0;teacher credentials then this: &quot;Instead try to understand the concepts, then write it yourself.&quot; Except in my lazy moments, when I just want answers <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_wink"></span>.<br>
