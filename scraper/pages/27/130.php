<br>It&apos;ll point you to a nice book for learning all the hard concepts behind assembly language. Note it isn&apos;t 6502, but I&apos;m a really big fan of Jeff Duntemann&apos;s teaching style. It really helped me out when I was a teenager cause I have a bit of a rough time learning technical concepts. But, I love programming so I don&apos;t give up.
