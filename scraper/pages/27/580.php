					I&apos;m still trying to figure this out conceptually, but what would be needed to have a projectile shoot diagonally. Not 8-directional diagonally, but any angle. What I am going for is something similar to what the Zoras do in Zelda (finding the player&apos;s position, and then shooting a projectile to that location). Not every angle will be able to be accounted for, I&apos;m guessing, and there will probably be some safe spots, but any advice to get on track with this would be great! I have mostly wiporked with four direction movement, so I&apos;m still figuring out some of the complexities that come with switching to eight directions. Thanks!
