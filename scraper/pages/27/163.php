					I&apos;m not sure what answer I&apos;m expecting, but I&apos;ll ask anyway <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
<br>
<br>At what point do you guys just give up on doing things the &quot;right way&quot; and just settle for something that works?  I find myself spending too long finding clever tricks which is really holding me back, and I&apos;m finding it hard to force myself out of it.  A sort of premature optimisation I guess.  I see the same thing where people spend all their time bickering over the best way to do something, to the point where they never finish their projects.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I really just wanted thank you all for the advice and tutorials here, they&apos;ve been a great help.
<br>
<br>Rob.
