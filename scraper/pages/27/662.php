					So if I am understanding this correctly, these are all preloaded?  I have been associating them more as individually defined (such as variables in modern languages i.e. int something )
<br>
<br>If thats true, it makes it a lot easier to grasp.  Is there a place i can go for a list?  My current sources never even mention them, and admittedly, the only harDcopy i have is copywrite 1980 :-/.  Also, are these NES specific, or otherwise limited in use?
<br>
<br>P.s. your answer was seriously exciting.  Every step forward is renewed vigor.  :-)
