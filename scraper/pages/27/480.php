					Quick question: NROM 32kB of ROM plus 8kB of CHRROM.<br>
There are 256 sprites tiles, and 256 background tiles.<br>
Can I somehow, with rendering off, switch them?<br>
<br>
Scope: I have a new project for a game where I&apos;m using all the background chr tiles for the game itself, and I still need background tiles for the starting screen background. The sprites tiles are mostly empty, and the starting screen does not use sprites.<br>
<br>
Hence I thought to fit the starting screen tiles in the sprites &quot;side&quot;, start the game using the sprites tiles for background purposes, then switch after pushing start to the correct assignments: sprites tiles for the sprites, background tiles for the background.<br>
<br>
It is this possible? Reasonable coding wise?<br>
Or do I really have to use something different than NROM?<br>
<br>
Thanks! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
