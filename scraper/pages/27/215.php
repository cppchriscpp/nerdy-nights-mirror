	Yeah, I was that way in math, but there&apos;s a certain level of understanding you need. If you don&apos;t understand WHY a chip does what it does, you&apos;re missing something fundamental that you NEED to know.<br>

	And MRN, I was just pointing out stuff I saw in his code, why bust my balls? Is it a douchy thing to help? Really?</div>

You just need to learn to state things in a less flatly dismissive way is all. Nothing wrong with pointing out errors or suggesting an approach to a problem. You have to be careful---what you may perceive as really helpful could end up being the opposite. You might even damn someone to a lifetime devoted to revenge.
