	Signed number are great, and two&apos;s complement is a good solution for what I can tell.<br>
	I was not affirming that your solution was unperfect, I was just saying that, _from my little experience_, to increase/decrease a coordinate by +/- one, two, three, ..., sometimes is easier and cleaner to call a subroutine with an ADC in both cases (+ or -) and when decreasing (-) ADD the negative (FF, FE, FD) value rather than SUBTRACT the positive (01 02 03); I hope all this makes sense in English. But again, probably in your case is better your way, or even maybe I still missing something you are trying to achieve here.</div>

What about the fractional part? <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_wink"></span><br>
