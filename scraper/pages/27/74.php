					I am trying to make a block grab a key (nothing like a &quot;simple&quot; port as a first post-Pong project). I have my block, and I have a two sprite key, and I have been able to get the block to push the key successfully. However, upon contact I would like to have the key move with the block in all eight directions. I have tried several things, but either A) I cannot get the key to maintain its position relative to the block on contact, or B) I cannot get the key to both push and pull with the block. I have also tried to map the location of the key to the block sprite, but understandably it does not maintain its position relative to the block.
<br>
<br>Looking ahead, where do sprites go when they need to be gotten rid of, say a castle gate that has been opened (and no, there is not an opened door sprite to take its place)? Are they simply turned off, moved off screen, or other things?
<br>
<br>Any help on these questions would be great. I will be away from the internet for a couple of days, so thanks in advance!
