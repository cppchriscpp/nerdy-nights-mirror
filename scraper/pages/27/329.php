<br>Yeah, I had time to read and understand the code for only the first chapters so far, so I&apos;m lacking a lot of knowledge. I built and added my own patterns for sprites to it, just as an experiment (I&apos;m more curious rather than really thinking about making a full game), and it worked out well. This is why I was guessing (correctly) you can&apos;t pick any of the 13 colors, just for the way the palettes and the data are stored. Thanks again!
