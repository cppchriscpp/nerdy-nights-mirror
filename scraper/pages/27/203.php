					Assembler does not matter. What you should avoid is old emulators, they aren&apos;t very precise and may allow incorrect interaction with the hardware. I.e. your program will work seemingly correctly in such emulator, but not on the real console. Latest versions of Nestopia and Nintendulator are good to go.
