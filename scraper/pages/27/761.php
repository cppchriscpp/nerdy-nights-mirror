					I have a question about directives.  Is it correct to say that things like .db, .org, .incbin, etc. are all specific to the assembler?  Are these specific only to NESASM?  And where could I find a list of these directives?
<br>
<br>What I was also wondering is, I&apos;ve seen words prefixed with a dot used as loop in some NES code.  Things like .loop to construct a local loop.. does this work only because of horizontal placement, and do they work like any other label?
