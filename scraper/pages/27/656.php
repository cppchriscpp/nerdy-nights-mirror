	What I&apos;d like to do is to swap some colors in the palette for the status bar, and put the original colors back for the rest of the screen.<br>
	<br>
	I manage to do this BUT instead of having the $2000 nametable starting &quot;below&quot; the status bar, it begins &quot;under&quot; the status bar. Am I clear ? (not sure ...)<br>

If you figure this out, let us know! I wasted a good many days a while back on this problem, and never did solve it.<br>
