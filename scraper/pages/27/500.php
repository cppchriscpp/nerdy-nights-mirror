Forget it...</div>
<br>
In case you haven&apos;t forgotten it, I don&apos;t remember seeing a wait for sprite 0 flag to be cleared first. &#xA0;The flag is cleared at the end of vblank, so if you check for it set before then you will get the results from the previous frame. &#xA0;Not sure if that was the problem but its something to check!</div>
<br>
I fixed the problem actually <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span> Also, I&apos;m lloking forward to see Beat &apos;em and Eat &apos;em on RetroUSB <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
