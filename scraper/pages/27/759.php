Hello, I&apos;m trying to compose my own music in .asm file. For information, I use nesasm compiler on Mac OS.<br>

What&apos;s the bytes range value for Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si on the Square and Triangle Channels?</div>
Not really sure what you&apos;re asking, since &quot;Do&quot; is the root of any pentatonic scale and doesn&apos;t necessarily represent a specific note value.<br>
