					I have a lot of extra time on my hands an think it is finally time to learn Assembly Language. Can anyone suggest some books for a complete beginner? So far I have &quot;Assembly Lines: The Book&quot;, but would also like something that explains &apos;how&apos; Assembly Language/Processors work together. Seems like you need to know basic electronics before you can grapple with hexadecimals If it helps, I do have several years experience with BASIC derivatives, ROM hacking, and a bit of Pascal.
