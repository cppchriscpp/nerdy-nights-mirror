					<div class="FTQUOTE"><i>Originally posted by: <b>Jazzmarazz</b></i><br><br>I don&apos;t know about NES but on the gameboy, setting volume to 0 on a particular sound channel&apos;s register just makes it very quiet! You have to disable it completely if you want it to stop playing. I actually found this out last night while writing a test sound. The emulator goes dead silent but when I slapped it my actual gameboy the sound was still present, but incredibly quite.&#xA0;</div><br><br><br>
Yeah, about same on the NES for what I have personally seen. Its not too much of a problem when all channels play, but still loud enough to be annoying.
