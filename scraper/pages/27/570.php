					I&apos;m back with more (hopefully not too annoying) questions!
<br>
<br>What&apos;s the best way to create big (as in fullscreen) images for cutscenes and the like?  I&apos;ve been using Shiru&apos;s excellent NES Screen Tool to import BMPs as tiles, but piecing the image together from there is painful, to say the least.  Once I&apos;ve removed dupe tiles, I&apos;m left with a big mess and it&apos;s really very hard to stitch it all back together manually.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll look in to coding some kind of parsing tool to keep track of where the duplicates have been removed from or something like that unless anyone has any better ideas.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Rob.
