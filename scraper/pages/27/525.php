					If using the palette 0, palette 1, etc. terminology, confusion can set in when talking with non-NES programmers/artists, since most think of &quot;palette&quot; as being the total range of all available color per screen. At least that has been the case in the few times that I have tried to explain things to people. Sub-palette seems like it would be a pretty accurate term, as long as one defines what this means (16x16 pixel area, or 8x8 if using the MMC5).
