					This is probably a Obscure Question and pretty sure it&apos;s been answered in Nerdy Nights but,<br>
I wan&apos;t to change the controls from A and B to the Left and Right on the D-Pad. But i have completly no clue how and Nerdy Nights currently didn&apos;t help. I was wondering how to do it but (obviously) it&apos;s difficult to make it possible.
