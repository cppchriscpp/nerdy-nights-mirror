					99.99999% is windows based. There&apos;s some assemblers and such which should compile on Linux and Mac. I run Linux and have gotten ASM6 to compile quick. But most of the tools with GUI&apos;s (Namtable and graphics editors) are basically Windows only. There&apos;s one IDE, NESICIDE, that has Linux and Windows versions, but I dunno about Mac.
