					Unfortunately ways to tell most emulators need eyeballs, like many get the grayscale flag wrong.  At least most people use old emulators so any tricks you do figure out won&apos;t be fixed!  Theres a few emu specific bugs like flags after BRK but it would take a lot of those checks to cover all the popular ones.
