LUTs likely the most common speed optimization, widely used everywhere from oldest to modern platforms, especially when memory/storage is cheap. Obviosuly, if you don&apos;t need speed, there is no need to optimize for it.</div><br><br><div class="FTQUOTE"><i>Originally posted by: <b>Mega Mario Man</b></i><br>

I usually choose what to do based on how much rom spacei have in my main code bank and what else i have going on. If i have plenty of cpu, then i use jumps and let the cpu do the math. I also sometimes just use lookup tables if i plan on adding many more options to the routine down the line. Easier to add a number to a lookup table rather than added a bunch more code and trying to rremember what i did to make it work weeks ago.</div><br><br><div class="FTQUOTE"><i>Originally posted by: <b>Mario&apos;s Right Nut</b></i><br>
These guys have it. It&apos;s not a clear cut answer. It depends on the situation and whether you&apos;re going to be doing a lot of editing/debugging.<br>
If you have ROM limits, use the CPU intensive deal. And vice versa. I usually run into ROM before CPU, but you never know.<br>
Although sometimes I like to code things just to see if I can do it!! Keeps it fun.</div>

Thank you all. Appreciated.<br>
The answer seems like in many things in coding: <em>it depends</em>.
