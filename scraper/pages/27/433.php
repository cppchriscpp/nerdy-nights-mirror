					Is it possible to take a .nes game file and extract the code so that it looks like the assembly code in the nerdy nights tutorial?  I looked in the FCEUXD and the debugger looks similar to the assembly code because I see many opcodes but it&apos;s still quite different.  I&apos;m trying to understand the relationship between these different files like .nes and .asm.
