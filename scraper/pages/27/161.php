	Someone may need to step in and help. &quot;.res&quot; is what I&apos;m familiar with in CA65...I actually forget right now what its counterpart in nesasm is. It might be .rs. Also, make sure based on whatever tutorials you are using that you&apos;re using these directives in the right places. .rs / .res needs to be used somewhere in ram (usually zp, stack, or bss). .byte, somewhere in your rom.<br>
	<br>
	for #2 yes, you just need to play with it and figure out how to transform the random value to something that makes sense for what you are doing. Usually this sort of thing takes a lot of tweaking to get desirable results that &quot;feel truly random.&quot; even though ultimately they really aren&apos;t</div>
Oh yeah! I use .rs when I declare variables at the beginning of my code so this may be it.<br>
