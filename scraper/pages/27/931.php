	Also, im new here is there a specific tag we are supposed to use for code examples?</div>
<br>
<br>
I use the HTML tag PRE /PRE<br>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_pre.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ta...</a><br>
<br>
to make the code monospace font. But I believe to be the only one in here to do so.<br>
There is a built in code tag too, but then the font output is quite small.<br>
<br>
Also, I see not red lines (maybe this is because I use the vintage version of the forum) and your code is influenced by smilies. So, sorry, I have hard time telling you anything relevant about it.<br>
<br>
You are definitely welcome, vacation time with lot of free time for me, and I like to chat about NES programming with people, Ask whatever you please.<br>
<br>
Kind Regards.
