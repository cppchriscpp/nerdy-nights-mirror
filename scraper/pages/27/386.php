	There&apos;s a number of different ways of doing it. One way would be to make a section of RAM your collision table. Just update the appropriate address as you load new background and make sure your character is referenced to the appropriate scroll point. i.e. instead of reading from the original background data in ROM, load the collision data into RAM.</div>

I think I got it. Thanks! I&apos;ll post another reply if I have any questions.
