					Thanks, man. I will. I watched your youtube videos on The Grind and some of the gameplay. Sweet shit, dude. I guess what you&apos;ve done is kind of the model i want to use. Though, I was thinking about a game more like Dr. Mario or Tetris for a first go, but I have a long way to go yet. I just got my feet wet.
<br>
<br>I managed to download cc65, fceux and run the simple &quot;Hello, NES!&quot; program. Even that was a nightmare. I finally found a good tutorial on how to separate folders, create the batch for the code and convert the file. Sweet deal. Now I am ready for some nerdy nights!
<br>
<br>I have a very long way to go, but I took my first baby steps today. 
<br>
<br>Thanks for taking the time to answer questions and share knowledge, man. I appreciate it.
