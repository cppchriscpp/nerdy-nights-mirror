					Hey,
<br>
<br>I have a question regarding preparing files to be burnt to eproms. must the header always be removed? if not how do you know what cases to remove the header? what is the point, is it just to make the ROM a specific size? Next I was wondering about checksum. Does it always have to pass in order to have a working file burnt to a EPROM ? cause I noticed when I apply certain patches to certain roms the checksum then fails but the emulator will still play it quite fine. Would this be the case if put into a real SNES ? Also what would someone with experience suggest to use to modify and correct checksums ?
<br>
<br>Thanks for your help
