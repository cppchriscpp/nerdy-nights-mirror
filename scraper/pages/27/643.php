					Can anyone explain how banking in PRG rom works? What confuses me is that the program counter is at a certain place, and then you need code in a different bank. So you jump to that bank, but the PC doesn&apos;t know that you&apos;ve swapped banks! So you&apos;ve just jumped to some arbitrary place in the new bank, wherever you were in the old bank. Obviously, there is some work-around, but at the moment, it just doesn&apos;t make sense how that could ever work, because the second you swap a bank, the code will be read from that bank.
