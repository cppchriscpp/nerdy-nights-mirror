	It is optional whether a game program is contained all within one text file or multiple text files before assembled into a final binary ROM that the NES or an emulator reads. Neither an emulator nor the NES can know how many text files created it. The only reason multiple text files are ever used is to help the programmer split up their code into logical chunks. You might have a text file that deals with the camera,&#xA0; a text file that deals with updating all enemies on screen, another to decode the map and perform scrolling, another for generic PPU operations, etc.&#xA0; It&apos;s all about organization.&#xA0; That leaves a ton of details out, but hopefully helps a little.<br>
