Doh! I&apos;m a dumb, sorry. You are of course correct. A 7yo kid would do math better (this is why I always test my code routine by routine, when I add whatever, to see how it behave). The logic at least it seems to be correct. Thanks for the correction.</div>
It&apos;s really easy to make these &quot;off-by-one&quot; type errors (so much that there&apos;s a page on Wikipedia about them), and I also make them all the time, so don&apos;t beat yourself up over it. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
