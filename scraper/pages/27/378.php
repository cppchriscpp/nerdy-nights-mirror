<br>Yeah after looking through the tuts a few times I had a feeling I had to add more to the engine. I was just hoping it was something stupid simple that I was overlooking.(like simply writing a value to the noise channel as I previously talked about) I still don&apos;t 100% understand his engine, but I&apos;m getting the hang of things. Its immensely satisfying having sound working. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>

<br>Thanks again!
