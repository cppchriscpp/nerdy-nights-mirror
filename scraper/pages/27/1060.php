I&apos;m assuming it has to do with how the controller is read or something because when I try to use the same kinda breakpoint on another variable that doesn&apos;t have to do with a controller it works fine.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I don&apos;t know much about using the debugger.</div>
<br>
I&apos;m honestly not sure what fixed it... but I put both MoveShip and MoveShip2 (copy of MoveShip but uses buttons2) outside the NMI, and created a JSR to MoveShip and JSR to MoveShip2 and now each controller can rotate each players ship.&#xA0;<br>
Not sure why that was needed, but it works... odd.&#xA0;<br>
