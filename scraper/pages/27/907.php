That being said, you need to acquire the rights, from the legitimate owners, to port such games to the SNES, and then hire a competent developing team knowing about SNES architecture to port the game (engine, music, graphics, ...) adapting it to such specifics. This is quite an important budget.<br>
<br>
If you ask instead for a game that plays similarly, but does not require buying the rights over such franchises, then the budget will be less, but still quite important anyways.<br>
<br>
There are few experts in SNES programming in this brewery I believe, who could probably be more precise about it, I really do not know how much time and effort would cost what you ask, but my guess is that, like GradualGames already stated, there is a ton of work, way more than what you imagine, judging from your light-hearted post.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps, I am not sure it does. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span><br>

Also, all this is as far as I know, I could be wrong, so please take this answer for what it is worth. More competent people in copyright matters and SNES programming would likely give you a better answer,
