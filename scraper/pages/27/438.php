					I&apos;m planning on a car racing game, top view like Off-Road, but with the tracks vast 4 screens instead of one. So I need a four direction scrolling routine which allows an inversion of direction depending on which direction you are facing. If there is any good tutorial or article about this someone wishes to link, or if someone has some time to waste in my favor to give advice, that would be extremely welcome. I never programmed a scrolling game for NES so far.

<br>Thanks.
