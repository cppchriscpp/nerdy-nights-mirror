If you looked at the memory while you were stepping through the code which had those $4012/$4013 writes, then yeah, the correct bank probably was already mapped in.<br>

Well, I tried it and it didn&apos;t work... is the address that the DMC channel looks at mapper specific? I guess I could try every thing after C000, like D0000, E000, F000... I know that&apos;s not how it works but it&apos;s worth a try. might explain why the DMC ripper I found online earlier doesn&apos;t work on it.<br>
