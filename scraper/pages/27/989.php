					When you&apos;re going into a pointer table you always have to do an ASL A because ASL is the same as multiplying by 2. Pointer tables are all 16-bit, since it&apos;s in essence a full address that you&apos;re basically skipping to. So multiplying the variable you load by 2 is preparing it to go to the correct 16-bit address.<br>
