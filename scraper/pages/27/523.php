					Slot sounds too singular to me. I would just say &quot;sprite palette 0&quot; or &quot;background palette 3&quot;. Shorthand on the Internet would just be BG PAL 2, our whatever. Slot would work fine too though, you just have to be on the same wavelength as the person or persons you are discussing it with.
