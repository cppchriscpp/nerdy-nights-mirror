	the aforementioned NESST can be used to make nametables without compression, and used directly in your game. You just have to remember that each uncompressed nametable is 1k worth of data. It&apos;s all pretty much game specific.</div>
NESST (short for NES Screen Tool, BTW) can also export RLE-compressed data, and 6502 source of a RLE-decompressor is included in the package. Shiru himself (author of NESST) has used the program to create the levels in some of his games.<br>
