	Simple Save Game Advice.<br>
	<br>
	I have the MMC1 up and running, with the iNES header set to 2 for battery backed WRAM. No file is created when the ROM is loaded, as BunnyBoy said would be the case in certain emulators (Advanced NN #3), but it seems that things are working (at least they are no longer crashing). My question is in regards to how to create a simple save condition. Let&apos;s say that I wanted a button or event (such as a text box option) to create a save file, recording the hero&apos;s location on the screen and the information for the current screen. How would this be accomplished? I can see several ways to go, but before I get too far down the wrong road I figured that I&apos;d ask for thoughts and opinions. Hopefully I&apos;m not over thinking this one,&#xA0;although maybe I&apos;m under thinking it,&#xA0;but who knows...<br>
	<br>
	Also, as things get more complex in regards to saving (weapons, events, character attributes like health, etc.), what additional things need to be thought about ahead of time? I assume that an answer to the question above will point me in the right direction, but did not know if there was any additional advice once things get more complex.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks for any help!</div>
<br>
Is there a save file when you close the ROM after playing it?<br>
<br>
Might be in the sav folder inside the emulator folder, also.<br>
