	Sorry, I was just nitpicking.<br>
	I meant, the sprites aren&apos;t actually changed when you change the sprite RAM.<br>
	But it is easy as changing it anytime you want, since you can just DMA one RAM page to the sprite OAM.<br>
	<br>
	Or am I wrong here?</div>
<br>
Oh, I see what you&apos;re saying.&#xA0; Yes, if you&apos;re being nitpicky about it you are correct.&#xA0; I&apos;m just trying to explain things to people who have no idea what you&apos;re talking about (most people reading this thread).<br>
