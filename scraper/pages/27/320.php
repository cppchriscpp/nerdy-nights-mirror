Thanks. Really clear answer. Appreciated.<br>
<br>
Yes, I knew c0 was for pseudo-transparency.<br>
<br>
Going forwards with my question, if you get time:<br>
<br>

<br>
look at the flying dragon about the center of the image: black + 2 shades + horns + wings = 5 colors<br>
<br>
Or course is made by several sprites (80x80px), but they really used a second sub palette just to add a single color to it? By the way, in this case black is the color of the transparency (the background is always black in battles _iirc_), or you think there is another transparent color around the picture, which increases to total to 6?<br>
<br>
Those are the heroes, which all use 2 specific palette if I understand it right:<br>
<br>

<br>
- BLACK, RED, PINK, WHITE<br>
- BLACK, BLUE, YELLOW, BROWN<br>
<br>
In this case, black is the transparency, correct?<br>
<br>
If so, all four palette are used to draw the four heroes and that enemy in the battle screen.<br>
<br>
And anything else, must fit one of those 4 subsets combinations.<br>
<br>
If not, how did they do it? (I know those guys from SQUARE were genius).<br>
<br>
Citation: &quot;I don&apos;t know if this helps, but you can change the colors in the palette anytime during the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is possible in the same screen refresh or only between two different screen refresh?<br>
<br>
I hope all this is understandable. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>

Thanks again!<br>

edit: mispelling corrections<br>
<br>
editII:<br>
Thinking twice, I guess that likely the enemy was made of background tiles, taking colors from the background palettes: you would need a very big ammount of sprite to draw that big picture as sprites, and iirc you cannot have more than 8 sprite each line being draw, and also, iirc the hero weapons had many different colors, which would require the other two sprite palettes for that I guess. I hope this reasoning makes sense...<br>
