	Is it possible to take a .nes game file and extract the code so that it looks like the assembly code in the nerdy nights tutorial? I looked in the FCEUXD and the debugger looks similar to the assembly code because I see many opcodes but it&apos;s still quite different. I&apos;m trying to understand the relationship between these different files like .nes and .asm.</div>

Decompilation is a very complicated process I&apos;m afraid, and even if you manage to decompile the ROM, you&apos;ll still need to annotate it. However, there are a few decompiled NES ROMs out there, like SMB3, SMB, Metroid, and Secret Scout (The latter being interesting due to being the actual source code published by the programmer himself)
