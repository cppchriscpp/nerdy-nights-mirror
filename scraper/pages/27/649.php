With 32kB banks, it&apos;s also possible to copy the bankswitching code into NES&apos;s internal RAM, and run it from there. At minimum it&apos;s just a mapper write and a jump, doesn&apos;t take much memory. Of course, you still need to duplicate code to handle the vectors in every bank, no way around that.</div>
Good point! I had a feeling that I may not have covered all bases.
