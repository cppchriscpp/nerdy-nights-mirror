So, I was wondering, if besides the few generic 6502 coding archieves around the internet, these NA tutorials, the articles and tricks published on NesDev, and <em>Shiru </em>site material, is there somewhere an archive of conventional basic routines for the mostly common tasks to be performed programming a NES game, and just limited to these quick common needs? Like this &quot;read inputs&quot; routine above by <em>Bunnyboy</em>? If there are none, does anyone else think that if one existed (or if one of the previous sources was expanded with an archive of such conventional contents), it would be convenient to refactor the code at its best, without wasting too much time?<br>

I asked this when I first started coding.<br>
