					Most emulators I know are written in C++: FCEUX, Nestopia, Nintendulator, puNES. When choosing between C and C++, it mostly comes down to your own preference. C is older and simpler. C++ has more helpful features and a larger standard library, but is much more complex as a result. It&apos;s not required to use all of the complex C++ features though, you can also use it as an &quot;enhanced C&quot;; in fact, this is what Nintendulator and FCEUX are essentially doing.
