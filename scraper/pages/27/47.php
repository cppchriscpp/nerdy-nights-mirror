		Sorry, I was just nitpicking.<br>
		I meant, the sprites aren&apos;t actually changed when you change the sprite RAM.<br>
		But it is easy as changing it anytime you want, since you can just DMA one RAM page to the sprite OAM.<br>
		<br>
		Or am I wrong here?</div>
	That&apos;s correct. (Calling it &quot;sprite RAM&quot; is misleading though, better call it something like &quot;shadow OAM&quot; or &quot;shadow sprite RAM&quot; instead because &quot;sprite RAM&quot; is usually used to refer to the 256 byte sprite RAM that&apos;s inside the PPU).</div>
Ok, I will remember that, kiitos!<br>
