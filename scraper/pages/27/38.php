					I am taking a slightly different approach to learning 6502 than jumping right into the Nerdy Nights. I have read the first 4 tutorials but before I move on, I am trying to learn 6502 from scratch. Every book I have skimmed always begins with hex-dec-bin and doing math with these. The next thing covered is explanations of the 7 flags and operand formats, such as indexed direct and immediate. My question is for some of the veterans to tell us what stuff is key and most important to know in 6502. Just so we have an idea what things we need to have a good understanding of. I feel like ASCII code is not useful for NES game making, so I have not spent as much time on it as I have with HEX math. I am hoping for a response that might give us a very skeletal overview of what stuff is integral. Clearly, the 6502 books don&apos;t cover sprites, sound, controller input, or anything to make games - it&apos;s just about learning the actual language and its concepts.<br>

Also, I am having a hard time with LDA/STA and remembering which does which. Sure, it might be easy for some, but I keep confusing the two. How do you guys go about this? Load the Accumulator and Store the Accumulator. Sound the same but do two completely different things. I hate having to look in my notes every single time. I need &quot;hints&quot; and &quot;tricks&quot; to memorizing key stuff.<br>
<br>
Do you guys take notes? Do you write things down in a notebook or do everything using the computer?<br>
<br>
Mostly general questions about approaches you take. Not necessarily specifics to a program I am working on. But that&apos;s because I haven&apos;t started my program yet. Your answers will help me move forward though!!
