					I personally really like CA65 for large projects. My favorite thing about it is the ability to use segments. So if you have to spread things across different banks, it is easy to do it all in one source file and have related code and data together. The only way to do this with simpler assemblers such as nesasm or asm6, as far as I know (someone please step in and correct me if I am wrong), is to cleverly use a lot of split-up files as .includes in a higher level master file that has all the .org&apos;s and .pad&apos;s you&apos;ll need to lay out your code and data in banks. I can see that working alright----I just like the convenience and &quot;pro feeling&quot; of CA65. Other than the .segments feature....I know I like to use .scope and .endscope a lot, so when I use local labels I can give them nice names but be able to re-use them later without causing too much trouble. None of these considerations should be important for anybody starting out, though.<br>

As for editors, I wrote my own graphics editor and level editor in C#. I&apos;ve previously <a href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=99434" target="_blank" original-href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=99434">shared these</a> for others to use, and I know at least one guy who used them to help him develop a game.
