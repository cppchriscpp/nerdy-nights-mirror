OK, here is kind of a tough question to which there is probably no simple answer to...but I&apos;ve always thought it would be cool to see some of my favourite arcade side-scrollers, like X-men or The Simpsons be ported to SNES, much in the same way that Turtles in Time or Sunset Riders did. How difficult would this task be? I would assume that you could take the source code from the arcade games, work a little magic, and have it playing on an SNES in no time, right?</div>
