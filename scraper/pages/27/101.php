					Sorry, I should have probably posted this here instead of it&apos;s own thread, but i actually didn&apos;t notice this sticky thread. Sorry for that. I was asking the following;
<br>
<br>Hi,
<br>
<br>I know how busy folks are, but I wanted to talk a little bit about one of my Favorite games on the SNES, Harvest Moon.
<br>
<br>I was wondering, how difficult would it be, to do a relatively simple hack of Harvest Moon? What I want to do, is firstly, go back through the dialong and clean up the typos and bad grammar. Second, I wanted to go through the Girls, and change the looks of the sprites for the characters to the more modern versions of them that appear in the newer games.
<br>
<br>At this time I think this is more of an educational exercise for me, but how difficult would this be to do? The characters dont have a lot of animations you would have to go through and change, (really they just have their directional walking sprites)
<br>
<br>My final question is, the possibility of adding character portraits to the dialog when talking to the girls...
<br>
<br>I dont know if this is possible or not as it would be a major modification to the game... Any thoughts on this?
<br>
<br>I have plenty of experience with C and C+ programming, also, but Im not exactly sure how SNES games are written, so I dont know if my skill will transfer over very well...
