					Thank you for all the help guys! &#xA0;I have been trying for a couple of days and I am frustrated. &#xA0;If anyone has any time can you check out my program and tell me if I am crazy? &#xA0;If im not if anyone can tell me what is wrong I am at a loss. &#xA0;The &apos;a&apos; button is working. &#xA0;It makes the character sprite dissapear (except for his eyes). &#xA0;Hold the button down and it remains hidden, let up on it and it reappears. &#xA0;This works perfectly for me. &#xA0;The problem is that any other button that is pressed seems to lock up the program. &#xA0;I check the hex editor and everything is haulted and the character doesn&apos;t dissapear any longer. &#xA0;I read all of the buttons with a read controller loop, but the only other button I am trying to do anything with is &apos;left&apos;. &#xA0;There is logic there but even when I comment it out it still locks up. &#xA0;Im very new to this so I am sure there is something that Im not seeing but I have stared at it so long I may not be able to see it even if it is there. &#xA0;I am super frustrated lol. &#xA0;If anyone has time to look, I have attached everything needed in a zip file except for an emulator. &#xA0;This is simply a test file to try out what I have learned from nerdy nights. &#xA0;I haven&apos;t gotten very far due to this. This is a nerdy nights setup, so hopefully you are familiar. &#xA0;<br>
<br>
*Oh and my flag variable, pDispFlags, only uses the first 3 bits so far. 00000321<br>
3. 1 = player invisible<br>
2. 1 = player left 0 = right<br>
1. 1 = player moving 0 = player not moving<br>
<br>
Any help is so appreciated. &#xA0;Hopefully I can get good enough at this at some point where I can provide the help instead of always needing it.<br>
<br>
P.S. The char file is original from me, I am no artist lol<br>
<br>
Edit: player flag info
