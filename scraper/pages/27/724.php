					Oh, I was aware of the CLI and SEI commands, I was just curious if Levanthal&apos;s method had any practical use on the NES, and the answer seems to be: probably not.<br>
<br>
And as far as GG&apos;s comment, yes, I am doing too much in NMI, that&apos;s sort of what I just today isolated as the cause of all my woes for the entire week (with MMM&apos;s help) ^_^<br>
<br>
Just looking for shortcuts, when I really just need to bury my head in my own program and sort out what NEEDS to be in the NMI and what can be stripped away and placed elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thank you for the responses<br>
<br>
Edit: Oh, and that high bit of 2000 thing, that IS the shortcut I&apos;m looking for. Unfortunately, I think for my purposes it&apos;s just inviting new problems into my code lol
