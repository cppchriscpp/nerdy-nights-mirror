	This is just the way NES PPU works. If you use y-coordinate &quot;0&quot;, the sprite will start from the 2nd scanline from top. So you can&apos;t place sprites on the very first scanline.</div>
And so to position a sprite exactly anywhere else you use posY-1. Good to know. Thanks, appreciated! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>

Any chance someone could confirm also that #1 from post above is doable in the nmi piece of code above?<br>
