					&gt; Is it correct to say that things like .db, .org, .incbin, etc. are all specific to the assembler?<br>
yes<br>
<br>
&gt; Are these specific only to NESASM?<br>
Some are specific to NESASM, while others seem to be &quot;standardized&quot; between assemblers. (e.g. a few of the ones you mentioned)<br>
<br>
&gt; And where could I find a list of these directives?<br>
