					Ok I have a vague question that is more an intellectual one, rather than an immediate programming issue. (If I were in process of programming something, I would be nowhere near as advanced as this issue in my endeavor).<br>
<br>
Basically I am just wondering how the scrolling in BURAI FIGHTER is conceived of, especially in the Game Boy version. (I have only baaarely played the NES version and the scrolling changes direction much less than the Game Boy version, at least in the beginning of the game).<br>
<br>
It just seems like such an unusual mechanic and I am wondering if it would be difficult to repeat.<br>
<br>
(At least on the Game Boy version) The screen scrolls in at least 4 different directions, (perhaps 8) and at times the scrolling is not strictly imposed by the level, but rather scrolls according to the direction that the player chooses to move in. VERY STRANGE.<br>
<br>
... So it is my understanding that SCROLLING is a very essential part of NES programming, something that the console was optimized for and one of the main things that sets it apart from its predecessors. (I assume that the Game Boy was set up in a similar way in this respect and I also assume that the NES Burai Fighter at least had SOME of the weird multi-directional scrolling of the Game Boy version). I know that the design/concept of scrolling in this game is quite unique - and I am wondering if the PROGRAMMING of this scrolling would be as obscure as it appears????
