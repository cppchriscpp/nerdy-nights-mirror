					Tried searching for an answer on the forums but I couldn&apos;t find one. I made some graphic mods to Hogan&apos;s Alley using Tile Layer Pro but once I play the rom on an emulator the zapper function doesn&apos;t work anymore. When I play the original rom, it works fine.&#xA0;I want to put it onto a custom cart but I&apos;m afraid it will be unplayable if it doesn&apos;t work on an emulator. Is there a way to fix this? &#xA0;Thanks!
