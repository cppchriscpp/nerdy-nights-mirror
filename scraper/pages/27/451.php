					Got a few newbie questions: I&apos;m trying to use the Sunsoft Mapper FME 5B, and while I (think) I understand so far how to organize my banks using <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Sunsoft_FME-7" target="_blank" original-href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Sunsoft_FME-7">THIS</a> as reference, how do I set up the ines header?<br>
<br>
From what I have seen in tutorials so far, the header specifies 16KB prg banks at a time and from what I am seeing, there are 5 8KB banks for this mapper. Would I simply set it to .inesprg 3, then for the graphics .ineschr 1? Or would specifying the correct mapper change that to 8KB banks, in which case I would set it to .inesprg 5?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help! And if anyone has any other articles I can go over for this mapper, I would really appreciate taking a peek at those.
