					Hello there,
<br>
<br>I recently started reading up on nes development (I&apos;m new to it) and I&apos;m currently going through the Nerdy Nights tutorials. I&apos;m moving through the tutorial at an ok clip, so I started thinking about what kind of game I&apos;d want to make.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m interested in making a puzzle game of some sort, but I&apos;m wrestling with the fact that there&apos;s a limit of 8 sprites per scanline (mainly because I was considering making a competitive two player game, similar to Tetris or Puyo Puyo). I&apos;ve been looking at some other nes games for ideas, and came across Palamedes.
<br>
<br>Now I&apos;m not overly familiar with Palamedes, but in its two player mode, it seems to be able to use more than 8 sprites per scanline (the well has a width of 6 sprites for each player). My question is this: does anyone know how Palamedes is able to accomplish this?
<br>
<br>Thanks in advance to anyone who has any insight into this.
