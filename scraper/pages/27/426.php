		How do you make aimed bullets on the NES? I can&apos;t figure out a clever way to do this...</div>
	Do you mean detect a collision between two sprites?<br>

<br>
No, I think I already know how to do this <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_tongue"></span> I mean having enemies aim at you and then shoot so the bullets come to you (but don&apos;t home), like in many shooters such as Gradius<br>
