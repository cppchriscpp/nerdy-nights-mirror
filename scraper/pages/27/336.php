<br>Thanks, appreciated.

<br>&quot;1. I believe the .bank system is exclusive to NESASM, even though I&apos;m not really sure about it (I never used any other assembler), but it&apos;s not an Opcode or anything. Actually, what it determines is where an 8KB bank starts. It does not necessarily start at $e000. You can also make it start at $8000, $A000 or $C000.&quot;
<br>
<br>So .bank 1 followed by .org fffa makes .bank 1 start at fffa, not e000?
<br>I mean the memory ends at ffff: would make more sense to me if .bank 0 starts at c000 and .bank 1 at e000. Just wondering, I&apos;m not claiming to be correct, I&apos;m the ignorant one here! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
