	$00xx should be used for pointers...only.<br>
	$01xx is your stack.<br>
	$02xx is what you&apos;re using for sprites (though you can use whatever you want)<br>
	so use $03xx, $04xx, $05xx, $06xx, or $07xx for other variables.<br>
	<br>
	Though MetalSlime uses $03xx for sound variables in his tutorials, IIRC.<br>
	<br>
	So use one of the other pages for your &quot;soft&quot; sprite variables.</div>

Thanks for pointing that out MRN. I remembered you mentioning it in your tutorials, but the tip about MetalSlime&apos;s use of $03xx will come in handy when the day comes for music.<br>
