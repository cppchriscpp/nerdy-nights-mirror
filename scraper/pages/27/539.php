	This is the reason why I asked<br>
	&quot;<em>This means you move by 1px each 256 on the speed scale?</em> &quot;<br>
	<br>

Yeah, sorry I wasn&apos;t clear about that from the beginning. I&apos;m not a people person to begin with, and English is not my native language. It&apos;s good with a fractional part if you want gravity, or just the ability to move less than 1px every frame.<br>
