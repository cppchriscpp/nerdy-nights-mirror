					Does anyone know how to get the Nerdy Nights background example code to work on real hardware? Based on my research, I have added &quot;BIT $2002&quot; before the first vblankwait and have written zeros twice to $2006 at the end of the NMI (directly before writing to $2005), but still nothing seems to work. Any suggestions?
