					For anyone using ca65: I am beginning to understand how everything is setup using Rainwarriors example, but there is a file that I did not find in the CFG or the BAT file called NESPROJECT File that I need clarification on. What is the importance of this file to the newbie programmer? 
<br>
<br>I see its listing palettes, setting output file names, etc... But I thought stuff like this was setup in the actual asm file (Palette data) and in the cfg? When exactly is this file called? Everything seems to compile just fine even when I remove it.
<br>
<br>I think (hope) this is the last thing I need clarified before I feel comfortable switching over to ca65. Let me know if this file is even needed! Thanks!
