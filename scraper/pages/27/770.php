I recently bought a super pro 610p. Could anyone explain to me how to program 29f016b or 29f032b, I&apos;m not sure which adapter to use so far. I have the Tsop to dip version 3 adapters and the additional adapter set offered with the super pro. Thanks in advance.</div>
I think you may have misunderstood the word &quot;Progamming&quot; for this thread. This is for asking questions regarding coding new NES games, not flashing chips. May want to make this a Brewery Topic and maybe search the net for some answers. This seems like it should be pretty straight forward, I bet someone out there already has an answer posted.<br>
