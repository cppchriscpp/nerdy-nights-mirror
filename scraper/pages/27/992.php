					Hi there !<br>
<br>
I&apos;m new to NES programming (and asm language), I followed the nerdy nights tutorials. To all the people involved into this forum and the tutorials, thank you very much !<br>
Apart from that, I&apos;m a developer and I did several games in C and JavaScript/HTML5, so I know general principles.<br>
<br>
So, I use NESASM, and I was wondering : what is the correct way to display text on screen ? Should I use letters as sprites with all the alphabet ?<br>
Otherwise I saw this trick and it confused me since I&apos;m not used to asm : <a href="https://github.com/PeterLemon/NES/blob/master/HelloWorld/Font8x8.asm" target="_blank">https://github.com/PeterLemon/NES...</a><br>
<br>
Thank you !
