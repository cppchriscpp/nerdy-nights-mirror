I interpreted it another way, but I think I understand. &#xA0;You can reference a &quot;normal&quot; label from anywhere in your code, but you can&apos;t make another label with the same name. &#xA0;Is the only difference with labels starting with a dot that you can reuse the name? &#xA0;When you branch/jump, does it just look for the most recent one? &#xA0;By horizontal placement I meant, two spaces before &quot;.org&quot; means the assembler considers it a directive, but no spaces before &quot;.org&quot; means it&apos;s a label? (Even though you&apos;d never want to do that, it seems to work)
