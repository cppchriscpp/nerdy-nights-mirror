					Someone smarter than me can give the real reason, but ASL is what allows you access .dw tables. It multiplies your starting entry by two, and aligns things. That is also why .dw tables are capped out at 128 entries instead of 256 (i.e. half). MRN mysteriously mentions that in one of the tutorials, but it is something to keep in mind since if you need more than that you&apos;ll need tables of tables.

<br>Thanks be to Metal Slime for understanding pointers, 16-bit addressing, and word tables in general, but I&apos;ll be darned if I can explain the technical stuff at the moment.
