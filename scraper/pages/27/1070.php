					That makes sense, thanks for the responses everyone.
<br>
<br>I like the buffer idea, I&apos;ve seen that with drawing logic and it definitely becomes necessary when doing music (per MetalSlime&apos;s tutorials) so I&apos;mma sharpen my skills with buffers and give that a go. And I&apos;ll definitely hunt down MRN&apos;s stuff and start working thru that.

<br>Thanks again, everyone!
