					Sorry Im full of questions today.  So I am trying to figure out the best way of holding simple player and enemy attributes.  I am wondering how everyone feels the best way of doing this is.  I know you could declare a variable for everything but am wondering if there is a better way.  I would think that a simple way would be to have a byte and assign each bit as a flag.  I want to investigate this but don&apos;t know if you can easily set/get each individual bit.  So if I had %00010000 where the &apos;1&apos; is the value I need (and all of the rest could be other flags set to 1 or 0) is there a way of just getting the value of that bit or setting that bit?
