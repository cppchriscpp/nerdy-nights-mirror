					What does a &quot;program&quot; look like, before you &quot;assemble&quot; it?<br>
<br>
What would an average length (in lines) be for a full (NES) game program?<br>
<br>
Do all (NES) programs have structural similarities? How is a program structured?<br>
<br>
Do (NES) programs have to be optimized and tweaked in order to display properly on a real NES, (avoid slowdown and graphics glitches)? Is there a big disparity between emulation and the real rom/cart/console?<br>
<br>
Is DMG Gameboy somehow impossible to program for?<br>
<br>
Can you answer these questions in a way that some one who has never programmed anything before can understand?
