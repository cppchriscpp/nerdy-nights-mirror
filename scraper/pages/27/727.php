					Are attribute tables really reset by chr-rom bankswitching? That sounds suspect to me. That should not affect nametables or attribute tables at all. My guess is if you use chr-rom bankswitching at the wrong time, you might be swapping in tiles that select different colors---perhaps all the same color (blank tiles?) and it&apos;d make it look like the attribute table got reset. That&apos;s just my guess. I haven&apos;t used MMC1 much though, perhaps it&apos;s wonkier than I remember!
