					Heyo! I&apos;ve been going through the tutorials and wanted to read up on mappers and swapping to try and understand what it actually does... 
<br>
<br>for instance, I&apos;m trying to create a text engine for later down the line, and because text tiles take up a lot of space, I figure it&apos;s be best to use mapping when a text box appears. What I don&apos;t understand from the tutorial, however, is what all actually changes in a swap. Will all tiles on the screen change to fit the swap, or only the ones I&apos;m changing? Like if I used a separate bank for the text and text boxes, would simple mapping work to bring it up without messing with the rest if the background?
