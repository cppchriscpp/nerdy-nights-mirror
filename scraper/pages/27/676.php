					In dealing with reserved space/.rs variables at the beginning of a program, how much of this space is there? Likewise, how much of it can be battery backed (or stored in a flash sector)? In what ways can it be increased, if at all? In contemplating a larger project, or simply a more stat driven game, it would seem that a lot of variables would be needed (items, character names, event flags, etc.). Even Family Vacation is using a lot of this space, though likely not too efficiently <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>. Time to learn!
