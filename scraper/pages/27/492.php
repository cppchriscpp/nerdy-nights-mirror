					Wow!<br>
<br>
Thanks to MRN, MMM, Vec, and BB, for all the answers! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
<br>
I noted down all the links (including Vec demo), I will look at them in the next days. I didn&apos;t remember NN had also chapters about this stuff. It is more vast than what I remember, it will be good to read it once again after few months (it was September when I followed it up start to end)..<br>
<br>
In the meanwhile, I expanded the demo, finding also a nice way to display the car with 2 sprites:<br>
<strong>L/R turn<br>
A/B decelerate/accelerate</strong><br>
The speed should feel constant (when speed hor/vert +3 &gt;&gt; diagonal +2x +2y, not exactly sqr(2)/2, but good enough I guess). The final controls are going to be different, I have something cool in mind about it, but these controls are good to test out stuff to implement.<br>
<br>
Time for me to learn these new concepts. Thanks again!<br>
