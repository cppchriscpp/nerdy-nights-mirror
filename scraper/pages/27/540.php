					Hello everyone! I&apos;m new here and while I do have some sort of basic programming knowledge, I&apos;m still very new to NES programming. I noticed that in the last build of my homebrew project, a few of the game sprites disappear when all of the characters stand in the same horizontal plain.<br>

I do know that if you have too many sprites in a row then they are supposed to start flickering, but these sprites just disappear completely. Is flickering something that I have to program in manually, or is this another problem entirely?<br>
<br>
Sorry for the newb question, but I&apos;m still learning all of the console&apos;s &quot;charming&quot; limitations. : p
