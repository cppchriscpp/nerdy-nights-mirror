	I do know that if you have too many sprites in a row then they are supposed to start flickering, but these sprites just disappear completely. Is flickering something that I have to program in manually, or is this another problem entirely?</div>
Yes, despite many people thinking/claiming that flickering was a hardware feature of NES, it in fact has to be always manually programmed in. The basic idea is that you&apos;d change the sprite priorities (index in OAM) from frame to frame so that different sprites show up on different frames.<br>
