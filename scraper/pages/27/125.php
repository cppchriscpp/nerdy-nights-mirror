					I think it&apos;s pretty good to use at least half of the $0100 page for buffers too. ($100-$17F) random 32-byte, 16-byte, etc. That is, if you can optimize a route to only touch the PLA instruction to get a value needed with X and Y for the other logic/counters it needs to use only the stack and those buffers to store crap to, it&apos;s great optimization.
