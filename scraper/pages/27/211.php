	Moving forward and not understanding is why you don&apos;t get it.</div>

Some people learn in different ways. Sometimes advancing beyond your means is helpful and you start to understand more as you go on. I can&apos;t tell you how long it was that I didn&apos;t even understand how my controls were working with eor and and&apos;ing and all that jazz. But I moved on to learn more stuff. I ended up catching on to that kind of thing. Like I said, some people learn in different ways. No need to talk to the dude like that.<br>
