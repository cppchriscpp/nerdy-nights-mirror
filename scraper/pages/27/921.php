					Im new to 6502 using NESASM.  I have a question about 6502.  If I have a buffer and two bytes represent the high and low byte of something.  How do I turn those into one address to load the value into the accumulator?  I think its called indirect addressing but not sure of the syntax.  Any help/example code would be much appreciated.
