					Thanks for the answer, but something else seems to be the problem. I would save the rom with a tiny minor pixel change in Tile Layer Pro and that would also affect the zapper functionality. There must be zapper game mods that were successful, I don&apos;t understand why resaving a rom with even the slightest change would stop make it unplayable on an emulator. Just for clarification, I&apos;m using the mouse as a zapper, not an actual nes zapper.
