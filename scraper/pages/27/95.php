					To all that replied, here and privately, thanks for your input. I had initially decided on using CHR ROM, due to many of the games that I enjoy using that format, but it now appears that CHR RAM does indeed seem to be the way to go. I made the move to MMC1 a while back after running out of room with NROM and not being able to plan ahead for battery saves with UNROM. My plan is to use INL&apos;s boards rather than relying on donors (mostly due to my lack of skills with that process; impressive stash of carts/boards though MRN), so that has influenced my decisions as well. I would like this to be an open question, however, so if you have thoughts I am still interested in hearing them. Just wanted to say thanks for those who have taken the time to respond so far!
