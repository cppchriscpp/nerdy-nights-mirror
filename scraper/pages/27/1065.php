					Fellow kids, a quick question about &quot;everything in NMI&quot;, &quot;everything in main&quot;, and how to structure a game.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve seen lots of different forums, articles on NesDev, answers here at NA, and other places talk about where to put the bulk of your code and mention something to the effect of &quot;if your game is small enough&quot; or &quot;if your game isn&apos;t very complex&quot;, etc.
<br>
<br>My question is (since no real context was provided in any of those places), what makes a game &quot;small&quot; or &quot;complex&quot; or &quot;big&quot;? Would small be something like Pong from Nerdy Nights or something smaller? Would complex be like SMB or Zelda II? I&apos;m trying to have some examples so I know how exactly I would classify the game I&apos;m working on so I don&apos;t have to do some massive overhaul later on and can do it more properly from the start. (Namely, deciding what functionality the NMI will do. Whether that&apos;s incrementing a counter like some people do, putting all the code in NMI which apparently SMB does, or making my code interrupt aware and going from there).
<br>
<br>Thanks for the help whenever someone sees this,
<br>LambBrainz
