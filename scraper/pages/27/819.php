					I agree on the fact that speed (and an easy to follow logic into the code) is often the priority above ROM space.
<br>Also, since the game data LOTs will usually fill up most of the ROM space anyways, wasting few hundreads of bytes in few code auxiliary LOT, won&apos;t make a big difference.
<br>I was just wondering if, in some cases, even other more experienced programmers use lookup tables as well for such purposes.
<br>Thanks everyone for the answers.
