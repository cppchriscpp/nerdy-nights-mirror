	Also, I am having a hard time with LDA/STA and remembering which does which. Sure, it might be easy for some, but I keep confusing the two. How do you guys go about this? Load the Accumulator and Store the Accumulator.</div>
If you really need to, write it down on a sticky note (either a virtual one or a real one):&#xA0;&quot;LDA: Load from memory to A, STA: Store from A to memory&quot;.&#xA0;You will without a doubt learn it by heart after using it for a a couple of weeks.<br>

As for hexadecimal and other numbering systems, I agree with KHAN. The most important thing is to understand that all of the numbering systems are just different <em>representations </em>for the same number. It&apos;s also useful to understand some relations between them, for example the fact that a hexadecimal digit (0 through F) corresponds to 4 binary digits (bits) (e.g. $F = %1111). But don&apos;t get hung up with conversions.
