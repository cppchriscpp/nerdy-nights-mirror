					Makes perfect sense. I will definitely consider this for the future, I also think I will have a better cut scene routine in the future than I do now, so that should help.
<br>
<br>I think for now, I&apos;m going to run with what I&apos;m doing as it is working. I think I am taking advantage of code a bit  with the way I am doing it (is what I&apos;m doing called two&apos;s complement), and I save a ton of ROM space this and I can still get 256 dialogs (even though I only need like 140).  I was mainly curious to see how others worked with this limitation. Thanks for the input, very informative.
