	3gen, can you post some of your code? I really want to see what beautiful flowing code looks like.<br>
	<br>
	edit: Just in case you&apos;re wondering, yes, I&apos;m serious.</div>
<br>
I have posted code in a few languages on here, dig deep. It&apos;s out there so I don&apos;t have to post code, just look it up, and really, just read the code. Look at the commands I use, and how I access the &quot;files&quot; as really, the best way to program NES is basically files in a table. I&apos;ve used this in basically every piece of code I&apos;ve done. I&apos;ve shown the multicart engine, the RLE engine(s), and the controller test, and probably some other stufff I forget which is already out there.<br>
<br>
I mean, you&apos;ll get used to it, I&apos;m more informing you that the code isn&apos;t too good. THis is a reason most seasoned devs don&apos;t help people. You just have to chug trhough and learn the basics well enough to teach &#xA0;yourself how to code better. And reading off of a volatile (<a href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html#volatile" target="_blank" original-href="http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html#volatile">http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywo...</a>) isn&apos;t good, just because....we don&apos;t know what condition you look for, even if commented. Better to put it in a variable, which is named, then we know what the variable contains, and then do what we need. It will get more people helping. And honestly, it is easier to code better. If you want source, it&apos;s out there, look at it first. Take their basics, implement them, and learn to program. Not read nerdy nights and take bits of code. I mean we all start somewhere, I&apos;m just trying to lead you on to a path that will make what you make good. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
