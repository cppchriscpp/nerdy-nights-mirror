	I highly recommend Al Bailey&apos;s Image Helper Tool.&#xA0; I&apos;ve used a lot of tools over the years I&apos;ve been making NES games, and his tool seems to have the best luck with making things look kinda right.&#xA0; You&apos;ll have to touch things up a bit, but it saves a bunch of time.&#xA0; I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m really allowed to distribute it without his permission, but I&apos;m going to post it until someone yells at me.&#xA0; It&apos;s helped me a ton so I hope it will also help other people.<br>

	Just go to Graphics &gt; Image Helper Tool.<br>
	Then File &gt; Load Image.<br>
	Choose the BMP.<br>
	Then when you&apos;re sure it&apos;s looking decent you can export the CHR, NAM, PAL, ATTR, etc, etc.&#xA0; It&apos;s fantastic.<br>

Wow, just had a quick play, but that&apos;s pretty much exactly what I was looking for.&#xA0; Thanks!&#xA0; And thank you to Al Bailey too, should he ever read this <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>

Vectrex, what you described sounds like a more complicated version of what I&apos;ve been doing in NES Screen Tool, but thanks for responding <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
