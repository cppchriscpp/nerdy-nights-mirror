					Not really a programming question, however, is related to. Which material are the original NES labels made of?
<br>I have the template from here <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/images/d/dc/NES_Game_Pak_label_template.png" target="_blank">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/images/d...</a> and I wish to know pricesily on which material print it after designing a label, to make it look like original NES games material.
<br>Thanks to anyone can help.
