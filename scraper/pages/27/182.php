					Hmm, I&apos;m messing something up with my sprite-&gt;nametable coordinate mapping or something.  My impassible blocks have now become impassible buildings of various sizes due to my awesome graphical abilities (it&apos;s a top down rpg-ish/shooter).  It just seems easier to keep 4 bytes of collision data for each building (x1, y1, x2, y2) and looping through to check for collisions in each direction, but directly indexing the nametable data would make more sense I guess.  And also be even simpler if I knew what the hell I was doing <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
