					GradualGamer: Thanks a lot! Personally I prefer BASIC/Pascal because they really aren&apos;t as limited as people claim, but there is something &apos;romantic&apos; about assembly language. Probably because I&apos;m rereading &quot;Hackers&quot; by Steven Levy. People here should check out that book, too. ^^
