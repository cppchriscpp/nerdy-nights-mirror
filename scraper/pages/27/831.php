					Hi Everyone, new here!
<br>
<br>I recently bought a GQ-4X V4 programmer and the ADP-054 16bit add-on. I am attempting to make &quot;The Firemen&quot; for my first repro. I have installed and updated the drivers and software for the GQ. When I start it and nothing is inserted into the Eprom reader, the program says acts like there is already a chip inserted. Is this normal or is my device faulty? I am using m27c801 and have already erased them. Please help!
