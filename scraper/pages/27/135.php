					When doing an inventory screen and a playing state status bar (for an overhead adventure), is it a better to use sprites for weapon and item images, or rewrite background tiles? I have the latter method more or less working, but noticed that Zelda and a few other games seem to use the former. I can see advantages and disadvantages to both (I think), so any thoughts or advice is welcome.
