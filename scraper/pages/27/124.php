					$00xx should be used for pointers...only.
<br>$01xx is your stack.
<br>$02xx is what you&apos;re using for sprites (though you can use whatever you want)
<br>so use $03xx, $04xx, $05xx, $06xx, or $07xx for other variables.
<br>
<br>Though MetalSlime uses $03xx for sound variables in his tutorials, IIRC.  
<br>
<br>So use one of the other pages for your &quot;soft&quot; sprite variables.
