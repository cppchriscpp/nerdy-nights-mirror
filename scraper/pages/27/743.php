					Here&apos;s another thing that&apos;s been bothering me:
<br>
<br>A lot of computers in the 1980s used the 6502 microprocessor, yet they had different graphics and sound capabilities. The NES I remember reading has a Picture Processing Unit, for example. I&apos;m not sure quite what my question is, but what nags me is how does the microprocessor access different graphic/sound hardware on different machines? The hexadecimal addresses for one graphics location might be totally different than another. Are they all using the same 6502 or a variant chip that runs on that machine? For that matter, how does the chip also access extra hardware that might be packed into a game cartridge?
