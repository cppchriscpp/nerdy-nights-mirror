Is there a bug in my emulator (MESEN), or a bug in the code somehow? This only started after I changed my code around to match the week 8 nerdy nights format.</div>
I would be very surprised if it was a Mesen bug <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span><br>
<br>
If it started to happen only after your week 8 updates, then it&apos;s obviously a problem with one of the things you changed. Since you said you commented out almost everything, I assume you&apos;ve already verified that it&apos;s not a problem with the new background copy loop, but is there something else you changed at the same time? Could you maybe post the full code?<br>
&#xA0;</div>
<br>
Yeah, definitely been scratching my head on this one.<br>
I zipped up the asm with my chr just in case its something with the chr file... I also uncommented everything back.&#xA0;<br>
Any help is appreciated. Here is the <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/6wj50q642o09cu6/firstgame_backgrounds.zip/file" target="_blank" original-href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/6wj50q642o09cu6/firstgame_backgrounds.zip/file">link</a><br>
