					I&apos;ve been working on this for the last five hours and am not getting anywhere, blah.  I&apos;m trying to change the attribute of a background tile to use a different color palette.  Maybe I&apos;m failing at googling the correct terms but I can&apos;t seem to figure out an easy way (or even a hard way) to find the code in the ROM hex editor to change them.  I can find the code in the PPU memory no problem.  This has all been done in FCEUX 2.2.2.  Maybe there is a more straight forward program to handle this task?
