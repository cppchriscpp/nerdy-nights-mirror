					I think my graphical issue was caused by writing to $2006 and $2007 at the wrong time. Both of your suggestions sound a lot simpler than changing a chunk of background data. I&apos;ll play around with them later on tonight. I think the background tile change might work better for my health bars. Thanks for the help guys.
