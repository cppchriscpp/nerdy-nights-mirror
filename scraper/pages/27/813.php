If you know how to use mappers then ROM space is almost never the limit. 512KB holds TONS of tables! I have used Excel to generate movement tables in many of my games. See pinball title screen videos <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span></div>

My issue is, I get picky about keeping certain code in certain banks instead of just moving it. Sort of an oraganizational thing. But, that&apos;s just personal preference.<br>
