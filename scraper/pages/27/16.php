	No questions about how to make repro, setting up homebrew companies, none of that.<br>
	<br>
	Just programming questions.<br>

Thanks, Paul.<br>

I intended this thread to be for people who are trying to program to come in and say &quot;Hey, I&apos;m trying to get this sprite to move across the screen.&#xA0; Here&apos;s my code.&#xA0; What&apos;s wrong with it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Or &quot;I really want my sprite to collide with the background and stop.&#xA0; What&apos;s the best way to go about this?&quot;<br>
<br>
The more generic questions are fine.&#xA0; I just don&apos;t want this thread to get so far off of what I intended that it fails to serve its purpose in the future.<br>
