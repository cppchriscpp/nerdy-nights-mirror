	Agreed. Even after days of struggling with the same, simple&#xA0;bit of code, the romance remains. Same goes for print. I even printed and bound the Nerdy Nights just to be able to focus in on them without the distractions of the computer. It can be nice to step away from the workspace and process things in your head without the pressure to try them out right away. Oh, and Dutemann&apos;s book is good. Being able to understand a few things, which the author really helps the reader to do,&#xA0;can give the confidence needed to get started.</div>
+1. I fell in love with assembly language programming in the late 90&apos;s writing graphics demos and games for DOS. Loved it ever since. Constrained to a retro computer of some kind, the simplicity of it is very appealing. I don&apos;t know that it&apos;d be the language of choice for a modern mobile app, of course, as the complexity just gets so high with modern computing you pretty much have to rely on third party OSs, libraries, cloud backend, yada yada to make even the simplest things work the way they are supposed to. But if you&apos;re into retro games and computers, there&apos;s nothing like it.&#xA0;<br>

QuickThumbs: I got my start in QBasic and C. It&apos;s interesting how often you see adherants of BASIC delving into assembly language later on. Not sure why that is---maybe driven by nostalgia for old computers in general, since those were typically the two languages you&apos;d see (asm and BASIC)?
