					When you have more than 4, or are keeping track of multiple bullet sets, counters are impractical.  You&apos;re either going to have to set up a new &quot;available&quot; variable for each sprite or use the position.  
<br>
<br>i.e. if he had 4 sets of 4 bullets all of which could fire as a set of 4 independently, using counters wouldn&apos;t work very well.  
<br>
<br>Setting up a bit more code to start with is easier to learn and has more uses.
