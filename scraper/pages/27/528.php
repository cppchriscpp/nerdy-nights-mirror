					I&apos;d probably use the first option.  I&apos;ve found that it&apos;s better to be more forgiving for players than less forgiving.  The second option is way too forgiving, the third option is killing people when they aren&apos;t being touched in areas, etc, etc.  But you also have to take into account how fast the ship is flying, and what &quot;feels&quot; right when the game is being played.  If you&apos;re using, say, the next to last option for hit detection, it might &quot;feel&quot; right with how fast the ship is flying and colliding with other objects.
