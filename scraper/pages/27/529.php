	I&apos;d probably use the first option. I&apos;ve found that it&apos;s better to be more forgiving for players than less forgiving. The second option is way too forgiving, the third option is killing people when they aren&apos;t being touched in areas, etc, etc. But you also have to take into account how fast the ship is flying, and what &quot;feels&quot; right when the game is being played. If you&apos;re using, say, the next to last option for hit detection, it might &quot;feel&quot; right with how fast the ship is flying and colliding with other objects.</div>
Thank you Kevin. Appreciated! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>

This is pretty much the answer I was expecting. Thanks for confirming that there is not a set convention on the matter, and that it depends mostly on the game controls and speed. I&apos;ll take note to tend more towards &quot;forgiving&quot;, when in doubt.
