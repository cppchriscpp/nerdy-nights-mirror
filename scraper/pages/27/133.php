Agreed. Even after days of struggling with the same, simple&#xA0;bit of code, the romance remains. Same goes for print. I even printed and bound the Nerdy Nights just to be able to focus in on them without the distractions of the computer. It can be nice to step away from the workspace and process things in your head without the pressure to try them out right away. Oh, and Dutemann&apos;s book is good. Being able to understand a few things, which the author really helps the reader to do,&#xA0;can give the confidence needed to get started.<br>
