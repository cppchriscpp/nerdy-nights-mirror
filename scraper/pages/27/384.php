					I have a little question about BG collision... I managed to complete KHAN&apos;s background collision detection tutorial, along with the metatile tuto, and now, I&apos;d like to know how to do it when there&apos;s scrolling like Super Mario Bros. (I can only make it on a still screen, think Legend of Zelda). Also, the game I&apos;d like to make is going to be 16x16 metatile based like Super Mario Bros just so you know.
<br>Can anyone help <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
