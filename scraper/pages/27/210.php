	Moving forward and not understanding is why you don&apos;t get it. Just gonna point out a logical error too: You don&apos;t disable the PPU then not enable it. You have to enable it (Or at MINIMUM NMI&apos;s) forit to be enabled. Your NMI might cause glitches if you don&apos;t remember, it can and does happen. Disabling, then having an NMI happen when &quot;off&quot; in the middle of doing stuff will lead to nasty bugs.</div>

Thanks for clearing that up.&#xA0;&#xA0; ...?<br>
