					I&apos;m have been studying 6502 for a while now and whilst it&apos;s trickier than the more modern languages (still not sure how all this memory movement actually puts something on the screen ), I have been managing fairly well.   However I have come to a dead end on directives. Can domebody give me a brief lesson in them using as layman&apos;s terms as possible (preferably with analogies, as I find those help me learn)?
