					Once your game is done nobody cares about what the code looks like!  Working vs a good design vs the best way makes no difference.  However a good-best way usually ends up being faster dev for that project and code reuse for the next project.  If my game is something I just need finished fast my code is very sloppy and inefficient compared to my full games.
