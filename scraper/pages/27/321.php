					Probably a simple question but, I&apos;m New at NES Programming, but I wanted the screen change to the menu after pressing start in the title screen, It starts with the title with &quot;PRESS START!&quot; in the first screen, but when Start is pressed, it&apos;ll move to the second screen with options. Is there a way to know how do I do it?
