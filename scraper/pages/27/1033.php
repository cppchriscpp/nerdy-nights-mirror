Is there a bug in my emulator (MESEN), or a bug in the code somehow? This only started after I changed my code around to match the week 8 nerdy nights format.</div>
I would be very surprised if it was a Mesen bug <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span><br>

If it started to happen only after your week 8 updates, then it&apos;s obviously a problem with one of the things you changed. Since you said you commented out almost everything, I assume you&apos;ve already verified that it&apos;s not a problem with the new background copy loop, but is there something else you changed at the same time? Could you maybe post the full code?<br>
