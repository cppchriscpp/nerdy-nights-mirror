neither of which look random enough to be an audio sample... Does anyone know what&apos;s going on here and can help me find the data I&apos;m looking for, or understand the data I do have?</div>
Your analysis seems correct. However, are you sure that the correct bank was mapped in when you were looking at the memory?<br>
<br>
In any case, you can quickly verify whether any given chunk is a DMC sample by copy-pasting the data into a hex editor, saving the file as <strong>sample.dmc</strong>, and opening it in FamiTracker for playback. (Note that you should not put more than 4 KB into the .dmc file, as that is the maximum amount that NES can play at once.)<br>
