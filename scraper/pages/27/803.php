					From what I saw in EBZ, half of the background is reserved for text while the top half is reserved for the background information- which explains why the game is pretty minimal visual wise. the space between populated areas gives the game enough time to swap out any info. It also explains the simple tiling of old RPG&apos;s as well.

<br>and because it&apos;s the one with the most coverage and tutorials on the forum, is using MMC1 much different than using UNROM? I&apos;ve seen UNROM mentioned but I don&apos;t see much about coding it, at least for NESASM.
