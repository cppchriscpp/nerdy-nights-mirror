	Is there a save file when you close the ROM after playing it?<br>
	<br>
	Might be in the sav folder inside the emulator folder, also.<br>

Just got back to this. Thanks Kevin. Save file was definitely in the emulator folder, along with all of the different versions that I had marked as failed tests. Live and learn.<br>

<strike>Another question (for anyone), when making a grid, what is a good way to go about doing so? Something like a name entry grid with the alphabet, for instance. I&apos;ve done a smaller one for weapons (2x4 locations), but I have a feeling that the branch addresses will be out of range for a larger selection process. I&apos;m guessing that the solution lies in some form of lookup (pointer?) table, but I&apos;m pretty fuzzy on how these work for something like background locations (well, pretty much for anything to be honest). I&apos;ve looked at Metal Slime&apos;s music tutorials some, but haven&apos;t been able to translate it to my current problem. Any thoughts or advice?<br>
<br>
EDIT: BunnyBoy may have already provided an answer to at least a portion of my question a few weeks ago regarding branch addresses being out of range. Still not sure if I&apos;m doing a grid in the best way possible though.<br>
<br>
DOUBLE EDIT: Even with jumps, it only made it to F before spitting back branch address out of range. I had a feeling 500+ lines of code might have been a bit much for it to see down...<br>
<br>
TRIPLE EDIT: Not sure how yet, but I might have figured it out! The cursor grid is working, even if all of the letters do not register (A-F I understand, but not really sure why &#xA0;W-d work <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>). Woohoo</strike>!<br>
<br>
Branch address out of range due to accidentally using a O instead of an 0. One more question that has solved itself...
