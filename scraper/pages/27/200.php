					Sorry guys,<br>
<br>
I&apos;m not as far along as you all seem to be at this point, but I just can&apos;t seem to find anything.<br>
<br>
My question is, if I plan to eventually move my game to a cart, are there certain tools I should avoid? Playing my game on a cart on my nintendo is the end result I&apos;m looking for and I just want to make sure I use the right tools to achieve this.<br>
<br>
Thanks guys.<br>
<br>
Edit: After going through a rather painful search mission, I gathered a little more information. I read that it is possible with nesasm using powerpak carts, or using new roms after performing some surgery on existing carts. Though the information is limited and I could use some clarification if anyone has the time. Most video tutorial tend to lead back to Nerdy Nights, and I suspect a lot of this information has simply become buried. I&apos;m having a hard time digging it up, I mean.<br>
<br>
As far as assemblers go, would I be able to burn a new rom using ca65? As far as pc to cart transfer, what is the better way to go? I know it seems early, but I want to make sure I&apos;m working with the right tools to begin with rather than fiddle around, get used to one and ave to change later.<br>
<br>
Thanks again.
