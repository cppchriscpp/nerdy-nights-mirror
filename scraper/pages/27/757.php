Hello, I&apos;m trying to compose my own music in .asm file. For information, I use nesasm compiler on Mac OS.<br>
<br>
What&apos;s the bytes range value for Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si on the Square and Triangle Channels?</div>
In the second part of Nerdy Neghts, written by MetalSlime, it is explained how to code a sound engine.<br>
<br>
Just check on the sticky of all Nerdy Nights threads to find all the info.<br>
<br>
Else, I&apos;ve been told you can use FamiTracker, which should make it easier, but I&apos;m too lazy and never really learned to use such tool.<br>
<br>
Maybe give a look to both, ad pick what it suits you better.<br>
<br>
Also, probably better programmers/composers than I am will give you a better advice.<br>
<br>
By the way, welcome!<br>
<br>
Cheers! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
