					That is an important question. All too many people get a bit too consumed with the &quot;right way.&quot; We see the opposite extreme, however, where there&apos;s no concern at all for the &quot;right way.&quot; It&apos;s a balancing act. It all depends on what is most deeply important to you. If it is more deeply important to you to build an entire game from end to end, then sometimes you may have to pick something that works rather than do it the right way. It&apos;s amazing how deep the &quot;right way&quot; can really go. When it comes to bugs and glitches, I believe it is important to always get at the root cause, or you can really step on yourself and make it very difficult to maintain your code. But in terms of choosing the right way of doing some aspect of a game engine---it is a balancing act.

<br>IMHO, if something is worth doing, it is worth doing badly (G.K. Chesterton). This quote has helped me focus on building complete games from end to end. Nice thing is---this quote merely helps remove inhibition, it doesn&apos;t mean I will commit to doing things poorly for all time. The code in Nomolos is pretty messy and ugly compared to what I&apos;m doing in Owlia, yet I&apos;m still aware of many flaws I could improve on for when I make a third game. I&apos;d rather have it this way than spin my wheels for years and never finish something!
