9 Sprites, in a row, the first one on the left is the lowest in number in the PPU (I hope this makes sense).<br>
<br>
Black area is the transparent color. Red area is not. Green is the scanline.<br>
<br>
So, the scanline &quot;hits&quot; 9 sprites, but doesn&apos;t render any pixel from the first one (since they are all transparent on that scanline): in such scenario the 9th sprite pixels on that scanline will be rendered or not?<br>
<br>
I can run a test in an emulator, but I wish to know for sure on real hardware.<br>
<br>
Thank you to whoever has the answer. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>

I hope all this makes sense.<br>
