	Humm, that&apos;s a tricky question.<br>
	<br>
	I guess (b) would be a logical answer but who knows ...<br>
	I can test on hardware if you want and have a test ROM.</div>
<br>
<br>
Here it is!<br>
(see attachments, test.chr.txt is the CHR ROM, you must remove the last .txt).<br>
<br>
And, well, in FcEux 2.1.4a the answer is A!<br>
<br>
Sorry, I cannot test in FcEux 2.2.3 under Win at the moment, and 2.1.4a it is not very recent and reliable, so it is likely that in real hardware (or on a better version of FcEux) it could be different.<br>
<br>
If you do run a test in real hardware, let me know, it would be very appreciated!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Reason for editing: I had hard time uploading .chr and .txt files.<br>
Also, I messed the test output, it was A, and NOT B!
