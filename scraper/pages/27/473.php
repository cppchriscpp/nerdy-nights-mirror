		So it&apos;s basically impossible to do unless I switch to metatiles?</div>
	<br>
	May I ask why not use meta-tiles? It&apos;s compression in itself.</div>
<br>
If the game background is composed by 16x16 regions, then the use of meta-tiles makes sense.<br>
If a game is designed with backgrounds composed by 8x8 regions, I don&apos;t see how meta-tiles can help.<br>
<br>
From his last reply, this is not Khan game case; but still, if a game background design freely mixes up many different 8x8 tiles, instead of being locked into 16x16 bigger tiles, then I think that the use of meta-tiles will not help simplifying things up.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>
<br>
Please correct me if I am wrong.<br>
