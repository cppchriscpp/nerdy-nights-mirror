	It looks like they wanted to load one row of tiles per frame to draw the box a bit smoother even though there would be attribute glitches.&#xA0; Perhaps they could have updated the attributes every other row so the glitches aren&apos;t as obvious.&#xA0; I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d call it lazy but certainly it could be done better.<br>

	Yours loads two rows at a time so it won&apos;t have coloring glitches, however the drawing isn&apos;t quite as smooth.&#xA0; A good tradeoff though!&#xA0; <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span><br>

Yeah, it&apos;s a way of working with the system as opposed to trying to make it do things that it cannot do well. My goal is always to try to understand the true limitations and work creatively within them for the best result (in this case meaning not an MMC5 mapper with its 8x8 attributes). Between cheap memory and no deadlines, there is not much of a reason (for me personally) to have attribute glitches or things like that when creative approaches to design can solve most of them. When I think out a project it begins with solving the technical aspects, how to load a text box, how to move a bunch of NPCs around the screen, etc., and the constraints shape the creativity that follows from decisions concerning those things. Uforia&apos;s are great, don&apos;t get me wrong (the best on the system in my option), but they feel like they are forcing a square peg through a round hole when it comes to some of the decisions that they made about the ordering of things.<br>

For rocky&apos;s question, also check out Faxanadu and Super Bat Puncher. Now&#xA0;<em>their&#xA0;</em>is a creative approach!<br>
