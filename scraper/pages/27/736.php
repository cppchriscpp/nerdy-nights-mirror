					I think nesasm3 and asm6 were written well after the NES&apos;s hey day, but CC65 (I use CA65 from it) as I understand it was based on an old compiler/assembler suite for Atari...I imagine it has been fully rewritten since then, though.<br>
<br>
From CC65&apos;s original website: &quot;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;">It is based on a C compiler that was originally adapted for the Atari 8bit computers by John R. Dunning.&quot;&#xA0;</span>For all I know this, too, was well after the 8 bit era. So I don&apos;t really know.&#xA0;<br>
<br>
I believe most of the tools in use were written by people active in the nes reverse engineering scene which appeared sometime in the 90&apos;s. So I&apos;m guessing all of them are &quot;modern&quot; insofar as none of them were actually used by nes programmers in the 80&apos;s, early 90&apos;s.
