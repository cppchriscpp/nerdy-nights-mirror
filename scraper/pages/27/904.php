OK, here is kind of a tough question to which there is probably no simple answer to...but I&apos;ve always thought it would be cool to see some of my favourite arcade side-scrollers, like X-men or The Simpsons be ported to SNES, much in the same way that Turtles in Time or Sunset Riders did. How difficult would this task be? I would assume that you could take the source code from the arcade games, work a little magic, and have it playing on an SNES in no time, right?</div>
That&apos;d be about 5 years of magic if my experience with just NES games is any indication. I gave myself 5 years to finish my first homebrew, and it took 3.5 years just for NES. So 5 years is probably a reasonable timeline for a large SNES port (<strong>not to conflate homebrew with port, these are different things</strong>, but going from one system to a totally different system would be a similar effort, minus original asset creation, unless it turns out the target system requires significant asset modification, in which case you&apos;ve got something similar in scope to a homebrew, only perhaps worse because you have to study somebody else&apos;s code/game behavior). That&apos;s working 3 evenings a week balanced with the rest of life, smarter/harder working folks could probably pull it off in 2 or 3 years.<br>
<br>
*edit* I of course forgot to mention, depending on the arcade game and how complex its hardware was with layering and sprite load etc. it may actually be impossible to do a perfect port to SNES.<br>
<br>
Unless of course you&apos;re lucky and the arcade hardware is really really similar to SNES or provides enough similar functions you could write some kind of translator...I guess somebody did that with SMB1 to the Genesis, but I imagine that wouldn&apos;t be trivial either...just from knowing the SNES is kinda difficult to program, particularly the sound chip from what I&apos;m told.<br>
<br>
*edit* Just looked up that SMB1 to Genesis port. According to this article:&#xA0;<a href="http://kotaku.com/5578821/super-mario-bros-finally-faithfully-ported-to-sega-genesis" target="_blank">http://kotaku.com/5578821/super-m...</a> &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t just the translator, a lot of manual adjustment had to be made.<br>
<br>
Still an ambitious project if somebody took it on. Programming is hard. (not to scare anyone off; it&apos;s a GOOD hard. You feel as though you&apos;ve reached the summit of Mt. Everest when you finish a project on a retro system.)
