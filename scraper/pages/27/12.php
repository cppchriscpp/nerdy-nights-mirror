If you haven&apos;t programmed before, I would recommend starting smaller than a scrolling platformer, say with an arcade clone of sorts (but as your FIRST experiments, even smaller than that---just moving something around, playing a sound, just getting your feet wet with the basics!) I think most of us started small in some way or another. I had been programming for quite a while before I started on the NES. At nes programming specifically, I&apos;ve been at it since november of &apos;08. *edit* note, I think the NES can be your first system, just be prepared to take it slow. Or, spend some time with something like python/pygame, then come back. Everyone&apos;s path will be different; there&apos;s no wrong way to start. I started in QBasic, in the 90&apos;s.
