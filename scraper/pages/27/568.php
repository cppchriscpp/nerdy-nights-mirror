	About the code... I&apos;ll just say that nobody (I think?) likes reviewing several hundred lines of of assembly code at once. So, you&apos;re more likely to get an answer to that type of questions if you accompany them with more concise sections of code. Of course there&apos;s a line to be drawn there, if some piece of code depends on some other piece of code, it might be impossible to help without seeing both parts.</div>

Haha, good point!&#xA0; I actually have the code split into different files and then included in, for some reason I thought seeing it all in one place would be simpler.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I&apos;ll just run with it for now and come back if and when (OK, when) I have problems <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>

Thanks for the debugging tips too - do you have any preferred debugger?<br>
