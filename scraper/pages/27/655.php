					I am trying to get Mega Man X3 to run on a X2 CX4<br>
<br>
There is this SNES flash cart I have called the Super Ufo Pro 8. It lets me play chipped games by placing a game with the same chip, as the one for the game ROM, on top of the flash cart.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, trying to play X3 with a X2 cart as the bypass does not work since the CX4 chips in the games are different. However, I read online that changing the the value of #$01 in an X2 ROM to #$00 will make an X2 ROM work on an X3 board.<br>
<br>
So inversely, to play using the X2 CX4 will you have to change #$00 in the X3 ROM to #$01?
