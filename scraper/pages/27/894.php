	Humm, that&apos;s a tricky question.<br>
	<br>
	I guess (b) would be a logical answer but who knows ...<br>
	I can test on hardware if you want and have a test ROM.</div>
<br>
<br>Alright!
<br>
<br>Give me an half hour or so (make it an hour to be sure in case other business pops up) and I&apos;ll provide you a test ROM. Of course, no hurries, if and when you have time.
<br>
<br>However, besides a real hardware test, which is of course extremely welcome, I&apos;d like to know in theory how should the NES hardware handle the scenario. If anyone knows.
