					I have two questions that are holding me back from collisions and by extension game creation. When doing a If A &gt; B Then C thing the syntax looks like
<br>  LDA B
<br>  CMP A
<br>  BCS branch
<br>But is this true if B or A is larger as I see conflicting examples when I look for this answer.
<br>Also can someone explain how ADC and/or SEC work to do something like If A &lt; (B+5) Then C?
<br>Thanks.
