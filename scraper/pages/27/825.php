					If my memory serves me right, NESASM uses LOW() and HIGH() instead of &lt; and &gt;. ROM usage is not any worse than in your own example (with the additional benefit of simplified code). This will get you to 256 entries. If you need more than that, you&apos;ll have to use indirect addressing.<br>

EDIT: got ninjaed.
