<br>
I see addition and subtraction are similar because the numbers increase to FF and then wrap back around to 00 and continue<br>

I have a lot of little pieces that I understand--it&apos;s just putting them all together to form a really solid view of what&apos;s happening that takes some time to absorb.<br>
