<div>I&apos;m a filthy liar <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span>. I looked back at my textbox code and I DO store everything in RAM. 258 bytes worth of data no less! I&apos;m going to have to change that, but look how smooth they are (even if the reloading data needs to be done in reverse in order to look better)!</div><br><br><div>&#xA0;</div><br><br><div><img align alt border="0" hspace="4" src="scraper/images/FFA98FB0-E58C-6573-938FD5361A199E4A.png" vspace="4" original-src="http://nintendoagemedia.com/users/16129/photobucket/FFA98FB0-E58C-6573-938FD5361A199E4A.png"><br>

And here is what I am talking about with Uforia&apos;s being lazy. The backgrounds, attributes, and sprites all get updated separately. That initial shift is how the game is aligning the tiles. I think that Derek did that with the first screen in Owlia too, but it has been a while.<br>

It looks like they wanted to load one row of tiles per frame to draw the box a bit smoother even though there would be attribute glitches.&#xA0; Perhaps they could have updated the attributes every other row so the glitches aren&apos;t as obvious.&#xA0; I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d call it lazy but certainly it could be done better.<br>
<br>
Yours loads two rows at a time so it won&apos;t have coloring glitches, however the drawing isn&apos;t quite as smooth.&#xA0; A good tradeoff though!&#xA0; <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span><br>
