					Great question.  I agree with Derek.  What matters most is that the game runs smoothly with minimal bugs.  A playable game with messy code is arguably better than a half-finished demo with elegant code.  
<br>
<br>However, I would like to stress code modularity.  There&apos;s a difference between inefficient (un-optimized) algorithms and unstructured code.  It&apos;s worth taking the time to think ahead and abstract your code down to the simplest possible modules.  In other words, writing an entire game in one huge function would be a nightmare to debug or modify, even with elegant code.  So code structure is more important than elegance when it comes to editing your game by scaling and maintaining your code.
<br>
<br>TL;DR: write functions that are well-defined and optimize them later, as needed.

<br>This is coming from someone who still hasn&apos;t touched 6502, so take it with a grain of salt <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_tongue"></span>
