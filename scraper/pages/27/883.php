					thanks for the tips! when putting it in ram, is there a specific way to do that? one time I tried changing a byte in a name table that I .incbin&apos;ed before loading it, but that didn&apos;t seem to have any affect. granted, it was one of the nametables that has the attributes included so maybe that messed it up?
