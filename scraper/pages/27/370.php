		There are plenty of threads elsewhere on this topic (let&apos;s not clog this one up ). Most end in stalemates between two polar views, with a range of opinions in between. Discussion can be helpful, but for most I&apos;d guess that it goes nowhere.<br>

		Oh, and welcome to the forums! A good question to ask, just one that has been beaten like a dead horse.</div>

	Could you kindly direct me to one as I did the search and could not find one. Being that are plenty of threads on this topic pointing me to one would be much appreciative</div>
<br>
Yeah, sorry about that, I should have included some links. Here is one that doesn&apos;t end in name calling and what not: <a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=7&amp;threadid=41096" target="_blank">http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/...</a>. It gets at the legal issues a bit better than most. I&apos;ll look for a couple of more decent ones, but on the whole they tend to go sour pretty quick, and do not always bring out the best in people.<br>
<br>
The search function for &quot;repros legal&quot; tends to get quite a few decent results, but it does take some sifting.
