	Ok I&apos;ve got a few questions. I only just started seriously collecting and also only just found out about these homebrew carts and repros and such. So i hope my questiosn are relevant... maybe not lol.<br>
	<br>
	1. I noticed someone offering really nice repros but only with certain donor carts. Why wont just any cart work?<br>
	2. How does one actually put a new game onto an old one? for example, placing Final Fantasy V onto an SNES sports game.<br>
	3. How do people make these super awesome personalized carts and labels such as with Battle kid?<br>
	4. What kind of programs and or equipment would be required should I study up more and decide i want to make my own games on carts? Where does one even begin?<br>
	5. Is this something someone could persue who has no prior knowledge of such activities?<br>
	<br>

As this thread is supposed to be solely for homebrew related programming questions, these types of questions are sort of off-topic, but I&apos;ll answer them the best I can, since the unicorn compels me.<br>
<br>
1. I noticed someone offering really nice repros but only with certain donor carts. Why wont just any cart work?<br>
<br>
Certain games require certain mappers.&#xA0; They won&apos;t work with any other mapper.&#xA0; If you don&apos;t know what a mapper is, hit up the google!<br>
<br>
2. How does one actually put a new game onto an old one? for example, placing Final Fantasy V onto an SNES sports game.<br>
<br>
Assuming the mapper is correct, you would an eprom burner to do these sorts of things.&#xA0; As I have no idea how this stuff works, since it isn&apos;t programming related, I&apos;ll tell you to again, hit up the google.<br>
<br>
3. How do people make these super awesome personalized carts and labels such as with Battle kid?<br>
<br>
I assume they are designing the labels in Photoshop/Illustrator and then printing them.&#xA0; The colored cartridges are available from retrousb.com.<br>
<br>
4. What kind of programs and or equipment would be required should I study up more and decide i want to make my own games on carts? Where does one even begin?<br>
<br>
Again, this isn&apos;t programming related, so you&apos;d need an eprom burner and god-knows what else.&#xA0; I don&apos;t know anything about this, so you&apos;ll have to ask a Repro person.<br>
<br>
5. Is this something someone could persue who has no prior knowledge of such activities?<br>
<br>
I assume people aren&apos;t born with this innate knowledge, so I would imagine it is teachable.
