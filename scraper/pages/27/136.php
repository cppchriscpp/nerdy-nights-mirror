	When doing an inventory screen and a playing state status bar (for an overhead adventure), is it a better to use sprites for weapon and item images, or rewrite background tiles? I have the latter method more or less working, but noticed that Zelda and a few other games seem to use the former. I can see advantages and disadvantages to both (I think), so any thoughts or advice is welcome.</div>

I&apos;d personally probably use a combination of sprites and background tiles for this. You&apos;ll probably encounter trade-offs unique to your own game. In other words, any graphics you use for sprites can&apos;t be used by the background and vice versa. Which one do you want to maximize? In a single screen game, you can probably use a combination without too much trouble. Obviously, anything that spans more than 8 tiles wide will have to be background tiles. Maybe use sprites for small, more colorful icons that stand out from the rest of the status bar.<br>
