					So.. I downloaded a number of assemblers to get started and I find that every time I try to open one it just closes quickly. Every single one does this, i assume it has something to do with my computer. I am running windows 7 Pro 64bit, has anyone else had this issue and know how i can go about fixing it so i can actually get started. lol, im dead in the water before evening having a chance to try and learn this stuff.
