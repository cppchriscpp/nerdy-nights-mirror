	Yeah, I was that way in math, but there&apos;s a certain level of understanding you need. If you don&apos;t understand WHY a chip does what it does, you&apos;re missing something fundamental that you NEED to know.<br>
	<br>
	And MRN, I was just pointing out stuff I saw in his code, why bust my balls? Is it a douchy thing to help? Really?</div>
Okay, we can do this.&#xA0; I&apos;ve not got in a good nerd fight for a while.&#xA0; No, helping is not douchy.&#xA0; However, a lot of the time the way you say things is really douchy.&#xA0; On top of that, your comments are difficult to understand and often not really correct, at least the way you phrase them.&#xA0; When I was first starting out people would tell me to STFU if I couldn&apos;t be clear and concise.&#xA0; So, I&apos;ll pass that wisdom along, STFU unless you can relay what you&apos;re trying to say without coming off as&#xA0;a dick or including any ambiguity.&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>
