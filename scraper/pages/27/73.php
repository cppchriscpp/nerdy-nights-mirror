					Hi, I had just wondering about debugging support... or debugging symbols more specifically...
<br>
<br>Can nesasm produce debugging symbols? And is there a way to load them into the fceuxdsp debugger (or maybe nintendulator)?
<br>
<br>I see nesasm generates a .fls file, which looks like a map for the labels. I also see an option for the listing output level, but as I far as I can tell it has no effect(?). Also, is there a way to dump the global variables to the .fls?
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve seen nlgen which generates fceuxdsp readable symbol maps from ca65 generated code... I assume I could write something similar that converts a .fls into a format that fceuxdsp can read(?) (or maybe it can already read a .fls?).
