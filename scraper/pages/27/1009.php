If you are decompressing outside of the nmi to buffer ram amd just writing the buffer ram to the ppu, then that probably isn&apos;t the issue.</div>
<br>
That was it, I was loading and writing the new columns in the NMI.&#xA0; I haven&apos;t fixed all of the bugs but the glitch is gone, now that I load outside and write inside.&#xA0; Now to see what else is wrong now.&#xA0; Thanks so much!&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>
