	Probably a simple question but, I&apos;m New at NES Programming, but I wanted the screen change to the menu after pressing start in the title screen, It starts with the title with &quot;PRESS START!&quot; in the first screen, but when Start is pressed, it&apos;ll move to the second screen with options. Is there a way to know how do I do it?</div>
<br>
I suggest you start with Nerdy Nights 7.<br>

Once you start getting good at coding, move to a more advanced style like this (Game Engine Building #2 by MRN):<br>

I don&apos;t think it can be explained any better than it is in the tutorials stickied in The Brewery.
