	Thank you for all the help guys! I have been trying for a couple of days and I am frustrated. If anyone has any time can you check out my program and tell me if I am crazy? If im not if anyone can tell me what is wrong I am at a loss. The &apos;a&apos; button is working. It makes the character sprite dissapear (except for his eyes). Hold the button down and it remains hidden, let up on it and it reappears. This works perfectly for me. The problem is that any other button that is pressed seems to lock up the program. I check the hex editor and everything is haulted and the character doesn&apos;t dissapear any longer. I read all of the buttons with a read controller loop, but the only other button I am trying to do anything with is &apos;left&apos;. There is logic there but even when I comment it out it still locks up. Im very new to this so I am sure there is something that Im not seeing but I have stared at it so long I may not be able to see it even if it is there. I am super frustrated lol. If anyone has time to look, I have attached everything needed in a zip file except for an emulator. This is simply a test file to try out what I have learned from nerdy nights. I haven&apos;t gotten very far due to this. This is a nerdy nights setup, so hopefully you are familiar.<br>

	Any help is so appreciated. Hopefully I can get good enough at this at some point where I can provide the help instead of always needing it.<br>
	<br>
	P.S. The char file is original from me, I am no artist lol</div>

<br>From what you say, maybe you have misspelled a JSR with JMP or something like that?
<br>I will give a look to your code later, tell you if I see anything.
<br>Kind Regards.
