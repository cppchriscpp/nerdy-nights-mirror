&#xA0;know when programming more modern games usually when a player jumps it is the physics engine that brings it back down, mostly the gravity. For nes do you guys implement a &apos;gravity&apos; to keep all characters grounded or do you just use the character attributes for bringing it back down?</div>
<br>
I tend to do gravity, but either works. &#xA0;<br>

For this sort of thing, I find <a href="http://higherorderfun.com/blog/2012/05/20/the-guide-to-implementing-2d-platformers/" target="_blank" original-href="http://higherorderfun.com/blog/2012/05/20/the-guide-to-implementing-2d-platformers/">this page</a> to be an amazing guide to getting you thinking about good ways of dealing that sort of thing in platformers.<br>
&#xA0;</div><br><br><br><br><br>Never programmed jumping, but I never thought of writing a &quot;gravity&quot; routine. Interesting.
