					Thanks for the tip <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile">&#xA0;</span> I guess the dice blocks Palamedes uses are part of the background, so that&apos;s how it avoids the 8 sprite per scanline limit. It&apos;s an interesting workaround, so hopefully I can make use of it. I hadn&apos;t heard of Palamedes myself until I saw James Rolfe and Mike Matei play it on their show.
