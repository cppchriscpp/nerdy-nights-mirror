	Baka94, no, you can&apos;t have CHR ROM and CHR RAM at the same time (not in any of existing configs, at least). The whole point of having CHR RAM is to get rid of CHR ROM, and use PRG ROM to store (compressed) graphics instead. Also, don&apos;t mess up CHR RAM with the Save RAM (WRAM, PRG RAM), these are two different things.</div>
<br>
Okay. Do I still need to put the CHR data to the PPU Pattern tables manually after putting it to CHR RAM? Or does the PPU do that automatically like with CHR ROM?
