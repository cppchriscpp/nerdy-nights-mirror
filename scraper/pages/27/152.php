					I have another question about my program... In my program, the &quot;randomness&quot; factor is determined by incrementing a certain value. When the button is pressed, this value is stored in the box to determine the letter. However, it&apos;s not really that random as you might have guessed, so I&apos;d like to know if there&apos;s a way to make better &quot;random&quot; values, which can be used for things a bit more advanced than generating a random letter like taking a random card from a deck of cards
