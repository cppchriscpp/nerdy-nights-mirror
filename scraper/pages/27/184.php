					That was an interesting read, thanks Shiru.  Way beyond my own talents at the moment, just baby steps for me at the moment.
<br>
<br>I have a single screen (created with your excellent Screen Tool btw, thank you for that!) just defined as a series of bytes - no compression.  Sprites are 8x8, I&apos;ve been trying to translate the player&apos;s X/Y coordinates to a nametable index by dividing by 8, then using tile_x * 32 + tile_y, but it doesn&apos;t seem to be working properly.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t post the code now, I&apos;ll try again later and include code to see if anyone can lend a hand.
