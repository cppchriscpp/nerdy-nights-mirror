					Hi there, I&apos;m learning how to program and code games in by spare time while I work on my graduate degree.  My goal is to use my research to make more realistic settings and stuff, my major being archaeology.  I&apos;m working with Gameboy right now using a C+ compiler so I can avoid assembly or whatever it might normally require.  I guess at this point I have a few &quot;best practices&quot; questions.  More than anything, do you know any good resources for GB dev?  I have been working with GbdevWiki and Retro Isle, but anything would be good at the moment.  Also, what do you suggest for sprite sizes?  I know that is a little subjective, but lets say for terrain tiles and enemies...would you have any suggestions?  Thanks in advance and sorry for the noobish questions.
