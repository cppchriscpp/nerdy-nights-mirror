					Here are few questions I need answers for:
<br>1. How do I change what&apos;s loaded to the pattern tables? Do I just set PPU address register ($2006) to either $0000 or $1000 and load new pattern table with PPU data register ($2007)?
<br>2. How do I make MMC3 mapper have save RAM and in what range of addresses it is located at?
<br>3. Should I write data that I want to have saved always in the save RAM area or write there only when game saves?
<br>
<br>(If some of the save RAM stuff is assembler specific, I&apos;m using NESASM3)
