					What is the deal with .bin files as NES roms ? I downloaded a monstrous rom collection and some are .bin files. I was really wondering about the game master rom. I am guessing it is the bios for the action game master. I was reading somewhere that a lot of NES roms used to be .bin files and that some old emulators accepted them. How do I get these to play ? They won&apos;t open through regular extraction. Can you use an assembler to attach them to something else and open them ?
