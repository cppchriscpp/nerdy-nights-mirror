	I&apos;m a bit new to NES programming, so after doing some research when some programming veteran brought up the term &quot;hardcoded OAM&quot;, I discovered my sprite data was hardcoded (my sprite is 16x16 pixels). I was wondering how I could make it non-hardcoded (hopefully this all makes sense to you). I was told to draw all the other sprites around the main sprite I use for movement, collisions, updates, etc. but I am not sure how todo that. Here is my sprite drawing routine:<br>
	<br>
	PlayingSP: ; These are the sprites during the game<br>
	;vert tile attr horiz<br>
	.db $B0, $00, $00, $20<br>
	.db $B0, $01, $00, $28<br>
	.db $B8, $02, $00, $20<br>
	.db $B8, $03, $00, $28<br>
	.db $37, $37, $37, $37 ;end &#xA0; &#xA0;&lt;- Ignore this.</div>
