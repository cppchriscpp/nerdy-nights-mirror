Well, if the code is exactly like it is in that zip file, you are missing row 20, so you actually only have 31 rows listed, and commenting out 1 row (which is working perfect for you) is bringing you down to 30, and commenting out 2 rows (which is giving you a blank row/garbage tiles) is bringing you down to 29.</div>
<span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_blush">&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;Wow... I mustve looked at my code a hundred times and never saw that I was missing row 20...&#xA0;<br>
Okay, so the laws of physics are still in place haha. So yeah, 32x30 is what I got, now I&apos;m good!<br>
