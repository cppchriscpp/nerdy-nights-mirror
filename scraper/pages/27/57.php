					I&apos;m sorry if you have already heard this question, and I have already asked it, but I am a Mac user and have absolutely NO idea how to program for NES games. I don&apos;t even know how to program, period. I have Xcode, but I need some help with that. What would I write first if I were to start programming an NES game in Xcode? And when it&apos;s all done, how would I convert it into an .NES file, put it onto an NES motherboard and into an NES cart? If none of this can be done in Xcode, what sort of Mac-compatible programming software can be used to do this?
