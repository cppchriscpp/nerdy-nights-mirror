	Yeah, it&apos;s a way of working with the system as opposed to trying to make it do things that it cannot do well. My goal is always to try to understand the true limitations and work creatively within them for the best result (in this case meaning not an MMC5 mapper with its 8x8 attributes). Between cheap memory and no deadlines, there is not much of a reason (for me personally) to have attribute glitches or things like that when creative approaches to design can solve most of them. </div>

<br>Very nice approach, and (judging form the animation that you posted) very interesting results: a very elegant solution to the issue! I don&apos;t think that drawing two lines at once will make the transition way less fluid than drawing just one (of course, this can be judged better testing the ROM on real hardware, rather than just looking at an animated screen shot), so I think that it is a worthy solution to implement.
