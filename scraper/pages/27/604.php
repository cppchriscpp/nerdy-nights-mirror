	Hey there,<br>
	<br>
	I&apos;m thinking about getting into making some games although I have little to no experience. At the moment I&apos;m just storyboarding ideas for the project I want to make down the track but for now I&apos;ll settle with some basic programming. Anyway, my question actually relates to the thing I want to make later on which is a sort of Double Dragon II proper sequel because lets be honest.. Double Dragon III just wasn&apos;t as good. In Double Dragon II are the stages pre-built with limits and boundaries in place or does the game read from a list of &apos;stage sprites&apos; to construct the stage as you play it? The same can applies for the cut-scenes between stages. Would the game be reading a picture of the whole screen or would it grab bits and pieces to assemble it? Hopefully this makes sense...</div>
<br>
<br>
The NES has 4 nametables (2 of which are mirrored, vertically or horizontally), or screens, so it has to load the stages as you proceed in the level.<br>
Explaining how the NES works would be too long to fit in a forum post, so I&apos;d encourage you to read the NESdev wiki and the Nerdy Nights, especially the scrolling portions.<br>
Also, there are a lot of people that had big plans at first (me included) but then struggles in their early months of programming. It took me years to put out something decent, so I&apos;d highly suggest starting with smaller projects before you tackle a full game like a beat&apos;em up
