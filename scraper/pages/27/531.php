	If bullets are coming parallel to the players shots (space invaders) then I think the largest rect is the best. If it is diagonals then more forgiving works better. Just make the game so fast that you can&apos;t tell the difference!</div>
Interesting point about the &quot;bullets&quot; possible directions. Thanks!<br>
