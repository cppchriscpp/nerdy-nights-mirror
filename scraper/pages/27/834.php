Hi Everyone, new here!<br>
<br>
I recently bought a GQ-4X V4 programmer and the ADP-054 16bit add-on. I am attempting to make &quot;The Firemen&quot; for my first repro. I have installed and updated the drivers and software for the GQ. When I start it and nothing is inserted into the Eprom reader, the program says acts like there is already a chip inserted. Is this normal or is my device faulty? I am using m27c801 and have already erased them. Please help!</div>
As in, it shows the chip type off to the side and the way it&apos;s supposed to be inserted?<br>
<br>
If so, it isn&apos;t acting like a chip is in it, it is just showing you how the selected chip type that you are trying to write is supposed to be oriented.<br>
<br>
You need to select the type of chip from the menu, if you haven&apos;t already... also, maybe a screen shot of your issue might help, if I&apos;m wrong.
