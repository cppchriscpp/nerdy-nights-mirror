					Hi all,
<br>
<br>Sprite Palette:
<br>
<br>Subset A / Subset B / Subset C / Subset D
<br>c0 c1 c2 c3 / c0 c4 c5 c6 / c0 c7 c8 c9 / c0 cA cB cC
<br>
<br>Total 1 (c0) + 12 colors, correct?
<br>
<br>Each 8x8px (or 8x16px) sprite can have only 4 colors, and one of them is c0, right?
<br>
<br>If so far I&apos;m correct... Quick question, simple curiosity:
<br>
<br>It seems no possible to have a sprite with, for example, c0 c1 c2 _c9_.
<br>
<br>A sprite can only get the colors in a single subset of a palette?
<br>
<br>It is this restriction true, or I&apos;m missing something?
<br>
<br>Say a sprite needs Black Red Blue Green, and another Black Red Blue Yellow, two out of four palettes are needed for only those two sprites?
<br>
<br>Is there a way to mix up the 4 colors of different sprites?
<br>
<br>I mean, for example:
<br>
<br>- color 00 +
<br>- color 01 from Subset A +
<br>- color 10 from Subset C +
<br>- color 11 from Subset B
<br>
<br>Sorry if the question was already covered somewhere, I couldn&apos;t find a clear answer.
<br>
<br>I know my English is far from perfection, I hope this is understandable.
<br>
<br>Any feedback is welcome. Thanks.
<br>
<br>Cheers! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
