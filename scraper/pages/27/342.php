<br>So you&apos;d just copy them in one frame and reverse them in the next.
<br>
<br>set a variable
<br>if it is 0, straight copy, 1, reverse copy.
<br>
<br>i.e. sprite 0 would go to 0
<br>1 to 1
<br>etc.
<br>63 to 63 in regular order
<br>
<br>i.e. sprite 63 would be copied to 0
<br>62 to 1,
<br>61 to 2
<br>etc.
<br>0 to 63 in the reverse order
