	Thanks for the debugging tips too - do you have any preferred debugger?</div>
When debugging my own stuff, I mostly use a modified version of Nintendulator called NintendulatorDX (that I also made) that allows me to view the original source code when debugging. But it only works with ca65. From time to time I use FCEUX also.<br>
<br>
If you&apos;re not using ca65, FCEUX is probably the best choice for debugging.<br>
