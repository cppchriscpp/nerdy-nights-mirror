					You only need to load the sprites when you&apos;re loading the screen for the first time. After that&apos;s it&apos;s just changing what tile each sprite is using, if you want it to appear in the same exact spot. Can you post your full code on pastebin and send me a PM?&#xA0; (I&apos;ll also need to see your CHR file)
