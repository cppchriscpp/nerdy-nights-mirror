	A transparent sprite pixel does not get drawn. &#xA0;But a pixel using the same color index (black) not in the transparent <strong>slot </strong>(first slot) will get drawn. &#xA0;So in your example if the sprite uses the first black (transparent) the picture will be red (background), and if it uses the second black (actually black) the picture will be black (sprite). &#xA0;This should probably have a cool sample image here... &#xA0;The <strong>slot </strong>is the important part, not the color itself. &#xA0;Hope that makes sense in English too &#xA0;</div>
bunnyboy used the term &quot;slot&quot; aswering to me few posts above, so I guess it is a good enough term to use.<br>
However, like M-Tee, I&apos;m definitely interested in what is the most correct term for it, both technically and English wise.<br>
<br>
<strong>Edit</strong>: never mind, I misunderstood the question. So the term &quot;slot&quot; is the correct one. Nice to know.<br>
Also, I use the term &quot;subpalette&quot; for each &quot;group&quot; of 4 slots, is this term correct too?
