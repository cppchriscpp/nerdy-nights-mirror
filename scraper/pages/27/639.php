					If using YY-CHR, is there a way to edit (and save) the size of a file? Instead of having it be a 256 tile sized file, what about just 16, or 32, or even 1? I can open MRN&apos;s question mark blocks in his CHR-RAM tutorials (week 6), but cannot figure out how to expand them to include more than the four tiles that he uses, but less than all 256. I have a lot of repetition in my CHR files, so I would like to have smaller chunks that can be loaded in and/or manipulated, instead of re-duplicating a lot of material (the alphabet, for example). I&apos;d prefer to be able to do this in YY-CHR, since it is my editor of preference, but if it is not possible let me know. Thanks for any help!
