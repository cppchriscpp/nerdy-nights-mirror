	No, I hadn&apos;t! I don&apos;t have much debugger experience, but using FCEUX I managed to trace the problem to the joypad routine - it is now fixed, so thank you for the suggestion<br>
	<br>
	Does the rest of the code look OK structure wise? Maybe I&apos;m getting overly hung up on it, but if there&apos;s something very wrong I&apos;d like to know now rather than a couple of months down the line.<br>

I tried your ROM.<br>
There is a sprite moving left to right. Pressing UP it stops motion. Did I miss anything else?<br>
Seems a fun game which you are planning to make. The graphics in the chr is cute.<br>
I let better assembly programmers than I am give opinions about the code itself.
