					I have a quick question for anyone using MetalSlime&apos;s sound engine. Is there a way to silence the noise channel other than setting a volume envelope with $00? 
<br>
<br>Say if I were using quarter notes and I want 2 drum beats, then silent for a quarter note, then one more drum beat. The only way I seem to achieve that is using opcodes to set a different volume envelope for that one time signature, then restore it to what it was before.
<br>
<br>This would be fine, but it seems a bit of a waste of space. Also it seems in both of the sound modes for noise, there is not &quot;off&quot; $00 and $10 still plays a slight noise. 
<br>
<br>Thanks in advance!
