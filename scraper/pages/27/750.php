					I&apos;ve been studying the MOS 6500 Programming Manual as a first step into getting into the NES and programming in general.
<br>
<br>There is some issue involving how numbers are interpreted that I need clearing up.  The manual delves into working with 8 bit numbers and how bit 7 can be used to toggle between a positive number and a negative number at the expense of using only 7 bits for the numbers themselves.  
<br>
<br>The question I have is, how does the processor know when you want to work with 8-bit unsigned numbers rather than 7-bit signed numbers?
