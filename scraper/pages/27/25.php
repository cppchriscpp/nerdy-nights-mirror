	Program before assembling is a text (source code), usually there are many text files with the code, along with files with various binary data, such as graphics sets, music, etc.<br>
	<br>
	Average length is difficult to say, and it depends from programming language, and data storage approach - sometimes part of it is stored as binary, sometimes it is encoded in the source code, various amounts. Anyway, no less than thousand(s), even a simple one-screen logic game could be like 5000 lines of assembly code or 1500-2000 lines of C code.<br>

Thanks for this reply Shiru.<br>

Could you possibly explain to me in a conceptual way, how the &quot;many text files with the code&quot; are grouped together? ... Is it eventually all organized in ONE sequential list of commands (&quot;the program&quot;)? ... Or is it that there is one core program with occasional instructions to &quot;leave&quot; and go to another, or to &quot;retrieve&quot; information from one of the other &quot;text files&quot;? Or are most of these extra files deposited by the cartridge in memory on the console while the program is running?<br>
<br>
Or perhaps it is silly to ask these questions at the outset?<br>
