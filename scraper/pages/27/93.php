					^^ Made good points.  However, I&apos;d say that from an actual build mode, assuming it&apos;s your first couple games (which are typically NROM or some other simple mapper), you should probably stick with CHR-ROM.  It takes a pretty substantial homebrew game to use all of the tiles in an NROM or CNROM cart even if you&apos;re trying.  AND the doner carts are much easier to find and cheaper.  
<br>
<br>But if you&apos;re going <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_teabag"></span> out and making a big platformer or porno or something, CHR-RAM is the way to go.  There&apos;s no exact answer to your question, it depends on the game.
