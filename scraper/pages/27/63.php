					It&apos;s ALL different. On windows, NESst and YY-chr 0.99 beta 2 (?) are the best tools for nametables and graphics editing. Compilers, there&apos;s tons to chose from. Nerdy nights use NESASM3. There&apos;s ASM6, most people use that. NESICIDE&apos;s stuff...so many more. I&apos;d worry about going over the basics and trying to understand the nerdy nights for. This stuff is so difficult, you have to do this for a while before you&apos;re qualified to know what tools to use to do anything, really.
