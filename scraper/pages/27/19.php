		Here&apos;s a great one<br>
		<br>
		Can some vets post the tools and programs they use to get started, and links to where to download them etc.<br>

	I&apos;ve been one to usually use Tile Layer Pro for graphics. I used to use Tepples&apos; nametable maker called 8name, but it likes to crash for me on Windows 8, so I switched to Shiru&apos;s newer program called NES Screen Tool:&#xA0;<br>

	I use ca65 as my assembler which has given me VERY little problems when building (I can only think of one confusing instance that happened lately). Google should find this rather quickly. There are other, more NES geared assemblers like ASM6 out there, but I just got used to ca65. It does require setting up a config file (I think the really good programmers call them linker files???), but once you have a basic one set up, you don&apos;t have to worry about it anymore. If anyone chooses to go the route of ca65, I can give a bare-bones config file that should get you going.<br>
	<br>
	Of course some sort of text editor, whatever someone is comfortable with using. I guess that is the basics of what I use. I can&apos;t think of anything else that springs to mind.</div>
Awesome thanks a lot Roth!<br>

In general could you describe what each of the tools you mention do, and what order you go in when programming? Or the general consensus of what you need to use each program for? I have looked around in nerdy nights, but the very first lesson just starts out with Codes slapped in the thread, with no explaining of what the objective is in sight with the codes?? I dont know if i am supposed to already know what to do, but i literaly have no idea and have not found anywhere explaining how to get off the ground.&#xA0;<br>
