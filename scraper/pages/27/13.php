					Here&apos;s a wild question<br>
<br>
Have any of the vet homebrewers (gradual games, sivak, bunnyboy and others) ever considered getting together and starting a combined company and start pumping out new games every couple of months??? LOL. Start the next capcom lol<br>
<br>
I know it sounds crazy, but all you guys are so talented i bet it would really generate a rebirth in new NES games and production would be so much faster.<br>
<br>
Im sure there would be alot of hurdles, legally, financially, timewise, schedule wise,<br>
But just sounded like a pretty wild idea.
