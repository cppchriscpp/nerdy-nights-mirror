					Good points fellows! I had completely overlooked color restrictions, since the first few weapons/items that I designed all use the same palette as the status bar. Since one weapon will probably be permanent, the combination method should work nicely, costing a couple of background tiles, but also saving a couple of sprites. So many factors to consider when designing things it is almost overwhelming. Thanks for saving me from some future frustrations!
