	Khan and MRN, thank you very much for this.<br>

	KHAN - The script will be very helpful, I&apos;m sure. I can&apos;t wait to implement it. What does dw stand for? I&apos;ve only ever seen .db before.<br>

Don&apos;<font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000" size="3">t clear out all the RAM, just the stuff applicable to the rooms.<br>

You can also use:<br>

&#xA0; .word</font></font><br>
