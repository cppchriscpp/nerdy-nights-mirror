		Moving forward and not understanding is why you don&apos;t get it.</div>

	Some people learn in different ways. Sometimes advancing beyond your means is helpful and you start to understand more as you go on. I can&apos;t tell you how long it was that I didn&apos;t even understand how my controls were working with eor and and&apos;ing and all that jazz. But I moved on to learn more stuff. I ended up catching on to that kind of thing. Like I said, some people learn in different ways. No need to talk to the dude like that.<br>

Amen. I&apos;ve been working as a software engineer for 7 years, have a degree in computer science, have published an NES game and working on a second, and it is *still* a challenge to fully understand my own code, let alone code written by others. Turns out you don&apos;t need to be a whiz bang, you just have to work hard and love what you do.<br>
