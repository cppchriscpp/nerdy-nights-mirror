					No worries, I just wanted to know if it was even an option before I wasted time trying to figure out something that can&apos;t be figured out (it can&apos;t, as far as I could tell). I did, however, figure out how to get the effect that I&apos;m looking for by using mid-frame palette swaps (I think anyways), though I may not go down that road at the moment. Juggling around different features and effects, and getting them all to mesh well together, is certainly challenging within the NES&apos;s limitations...
