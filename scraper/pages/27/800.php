					ahh okay! 
<br>
<br>This helped close the gap for sure- so I&apos;d only really use the bank swapping if I Was getting into an egregious amount of information? I see in MRN&apos;s examples he uses NROM with CHR RAM to animate blocks- The reason it confused me mostly was because I was trying to think about how in EB zero, the text boxes pop up but the background never changes- using FCEUXD I saw that it just tends tend to switch out partial data quite a bit!
<br>
<br>Thank you very much for the help!
