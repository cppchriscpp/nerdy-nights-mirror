					In that example, if the grey were set as the transparent color, I could see that working. At least I wouldn&apos;t see why not!<br>

I have not played with sprite zero much, but I would think you could just make a routine that checks the sprite zero flag and which car it belongs to each frame since it either overlaps or it&apos;s not.<br>
