					Since the topic of the week has been cleaning up/optimizing code, I had a question or two. For the most part my game engine has followed that of the Nerdy Nights, except that since Pong only had one screen for the playing state I did not know how to do individual rooms. At the moment, I have each room as a separate game state, which leads to a LOT of duplicated code since all of the playing state material is re-written for each room. Is this the correct way to do things? I am guessing not <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>, and from beginning to understand MRN&apos;s room indexing lesson I can see what appears to be another way (though I have not figured out how non-player character sprites are updated in new rooms), but could use whatever advice folks have to offer. Thanks!
