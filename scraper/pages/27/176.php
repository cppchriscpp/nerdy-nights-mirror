					No, a game state would be like Pause, Cut Screens, Main Game, Death, etc. where there are different types of game functions.  I&apos;m pretty sure #6 (or there abouts) discusses this.  An &quot;engine&quot; would work with whatever you put into it.  It sounds like you&apos;re &quot;hard coding&quot; rooms if you have to make a different GS for each one.
