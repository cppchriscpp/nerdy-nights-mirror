					This is more than i can reasonably type out and demonstrate on a phone. If someone hasn&apos;t helped by the time i get off work in about 7 hours i can help with the basics. In the mean time look up how bounding boxes work with collision. Basically you&apos;ll want to update the x0, x1, y0, and y1 coordinates for both the ball and each paddle separately. Then check for the actual collision. Sorry i can&apos;t help more at the moment.
