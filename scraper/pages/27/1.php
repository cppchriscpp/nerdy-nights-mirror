					Ok I&apos;ve got a few questions. I only just started seriously collecting and also only just found out about these homebrew carts and repros and such. So i hope my questiosn are relevant... maybe not lol.
<br>
<br>1. I noticed someone offering really nice repros but only with certain donor carts. Why wont just any cart work?
<br>2. How does one actually put a new game onto an old one? for example, placing Final Fantasy V onto an SNES sports game.
<br>3. How do people make these super awesome personalized carts and labels such as with Battle kid?
<br>4. What kind of programs and or equipment would be required should I study up more and decide i want to make my own games on carts? Where does one even begin?
<br>5. Is this something someone could persue who has no prior knowledge of such activities?
<br>
