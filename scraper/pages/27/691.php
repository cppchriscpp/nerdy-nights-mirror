					I want to compare the player &quot;box&quot; to the enemies &quot;box&quot; to test for collision. Is the proper way to do it is to compare wheter each of the box corners (x,y) lies inside the enemy box? I know this will work, but I am not sure is the optimal way, plus there may be a trick on ASM I might be missing as I am not proficient at binary tricks.
