					Hmm, not really sure what is going on with this, but here goes. I&apos;ve got saves up and running, for the most part, but have a small problem. The program seems to only be reading the first 15 .rs spaces (bytes?) at $6000. I&apos;ve moved things around in terms of order, and this seems to be what is going on (i.e. if things are switched around, different things save, etc.). Is this normal? Any thoughts?
