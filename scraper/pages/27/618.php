					For total beginners to programming, there is a path which I think has potential to help people learn some of the ideas behind assembly language programming so that it is easier to pick up the knowledge from the Nerdy Nights tutorials. As good as those tutorials are, they&apos;re probably not good enough to get somebody started from ground 0. There&apos;s a really good book however (not NES related, but still assembly language) which I think can be a big help. When I first tried to learn assembly language I did have a bit of programming background but not much. I didn&apos;t know where to start with assembly language. I got a bunch of books read lots of online tutorials (this was the late 90&apos;s...) and couldn&apos;t figure it out. Then I found &quot;Assembly Language: Step by Step&quot; by Jeff Duntemann. It&apos;s an old book, covers DOS assembly language...does not show you how to code games. BUT, if you&apos;re willing to put in a few weeks reading it, it should help break the ice for you. The conversational, down to earth style of the author is unparalleled. Check out my thread about this book:
