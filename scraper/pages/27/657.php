What I&apos;d like to do is to swap some colors in the palette for the status bar, and put the original colors back for the rest of the screen.<br>
<br>
I manage to do this BUT instead of having the $2000 nametable starting &quot;below&quot; the status bar, it begins &quot;under&quot; the status bar. Am I clear ? (not sure ...)<br>

If you figure this out, let us know! I wasted a good many days a while back on this problem, and never did solve it.<br>

3x. I could never find a way to change palette colors in similar scenarios. And I just gave up with the idea.<br>
I guess that better experienced NES programmers could manage it, but I also fear that the architcture of the NES was perhaps not planned for such task.<br>
I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m just talking in a deductive way from my past experience and silly experiments wth NES coding. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
