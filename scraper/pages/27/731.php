Is this the right place to ask about how to make a dmc file? I&apos;ve found various code and tutorials on their use, but not their creation! I know famitracker can convert instruments, but those are all fti, right?... I found a huge repository of dmc files, but I&apos;d still like to be able to produce my own.</div>
<br>
I definitely don&apos;t know the answer to this question, as I never use the DMC channel. Hopefully someone smarter than me (ie: most people) can help you.<br>
