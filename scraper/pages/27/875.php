	That&apos;s implementation question. I mean that there is negation required, which is replaced with eor #$ff, but that&apos;s not really negation (similar, just off by one). So, for matematically correct results a proper negation should be used, but the code of course will be less efficient, that&apos;s why that replacement took place.</div>

Thanks, really appreciated.<br>
I opened a specific thread in the brewery about this topic, proposing an alternative approach, in case you have some time and would like to continue the conversation, I&apos;d be glad to know opinions about it.<br>
Again, thanks for all your answers, it really helps to get opinions and explanations by more experienced programmers. It also helps the process of bringing your own ideas together. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_happy">&#xA0;</span>
