					Is there a way to just change the 2 bits in the attribute table with you disturbing the out 6 bits?<br>
<br>
For example. At $23EB, the current attribute is 11111111. Lets say, I want to change the second set to 00, so 11<strong>00</strong>1111 (so now the top right quadrant is using Palette 00). On the next players turn, I want to change the 4th set to 01, so 110011<strong>01. </strong>At any time, I want to be able to change any of those 4 sets of 2 bits.<br>
<br>
Attributes are such a pain. This seems like this should be pretty simple, I&apos;m finding that it is not.
