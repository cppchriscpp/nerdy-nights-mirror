					Just a little question about MMC1 mapping.<br>
I&apos;m using this mapper with 32KB bankswitching, and I was just wondering how this kind of PRG bankswitching works. (I know how MMC1 bankswitching works, I&apos;m just wondering how the NES works when you switch banks, as I want to switch banks during some routines)
