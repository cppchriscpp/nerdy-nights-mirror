					I did this in Bust-A-Nut and The Grind.  Two moving things (you and the NPC) and the NPC is shooting at you.  
<br>
<br>There are several different ways of doing it.  Look up tables is a good one.  There&apos;s also a method someone posted on NA that I foolishly neglected to write down which would have worked better.
<br>
<br>I used trig to make it work properly.  You just assign each object to the points on a right triangle and make sure it knows which way is up/down, left/right.  Figure out the rise and run, divide them (which is on top/on bottof of the division depends on up/down, left/right), and you get X pixels of vertical travel for Y pixels of horizontal that hits the target 90% of the time (IIRC).  Problem is, isn&apos;t not a constant speed.  The one that I can&apos;t find is a constant speed.
