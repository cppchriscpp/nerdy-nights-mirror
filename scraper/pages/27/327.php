	I figured out few things reasoning by myself (see also my edit of the post above about the sprites displayed on a specific scan line limits), but it is useful to get confirmation from someone with<strong> more experience</strong>.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;The game I am making...&quot;<br>
	Good luck (or whatever wish fits the best) with it, of course!<br>

Not too much more experience than you, I started in March 2014! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span><br>

And as for my game, it&apos;s not much, but it has been a great learning tool for me. I asked and researched a lot of the same questions you are asking. I highly suggest the Nerdy Nights tutorials and then start working through Mario&apos;s Right Nut&apos;s tutorials (these are pretty advanced, at least for me).<br>
