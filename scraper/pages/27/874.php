					That&apos;s implementation question. I mean that there is negation required, which is replaced with eor #$ff, but that&apos;s not really negation (similar, just off by one). So, for matematically correct results a proper negation should be used, but the code of course will be less efficient, that&apos;s why that replacement took place.
