					Two very basic questions today <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
<br>
<br>-Can subroutines be placed into subfolders? Or does this only work for other types of data? I changed a bunch of stuff around and tried using subfolders for the first time, but it does not seem to be reading them and the program fails to compile.
<br>
<br>-What is the difference between JSR and JMP? When should one be used and not the other? I get the feeling that I&apos;ve been a little too lucky in guessing which one to use and haven&apos;t learned the hard way yet...
