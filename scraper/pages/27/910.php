are you sure that the correct bank was mapped in when you were looking at the memory?<br>

<br>
Hadn&apos;t thought of that... But since it&apos;s loading from the NES memory and not straight from the ROM, wouldn&apos;t whatever is in C000 at the time be the right data...? I&apos;ll put it through famitracker and see what happens, and try all the C000&apos;s from the ROM hex as well. Thanks!<br>
