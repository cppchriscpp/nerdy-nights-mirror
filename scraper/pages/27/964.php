					So I could use a little help, I was told that my code was doing most of it&apos;s logic in the NMI which is generally frowned upon, I&apos;m trying to rearrange the code as so that is not so, I managed to get the file to compile, but now lost my ability to move sprites, if anyone would be willing to help me grokk this out I would really appreciate it, Assembly is hard lol <a href="https://hastebin.com/wahulohivi.pl" target="_blank" original-href="https://hastebin.com/wahulohivi.pl">https://hastebin.com/wahulohivi.p...</a>
