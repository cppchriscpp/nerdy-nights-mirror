	Well, the code looked okay with the right sprite spots moving. I&apos;d say just....I dunno, that should be it. Honestly as someone who has finished a project Nerdy Nights has good stuff, but man it definitely doesn&apos;t teach you how to properly program, just get stuff working. And storing data....incbin is 100x better than including it with .db&apos;s, but oh well. I&apos;d say fiddle with it more, if you need more help paste bin it and message me I&apos;ll look again if I see something blatantly wrong.</div>

Ok, I could&apos;ve said this when i was first asking, but i was new at NES Assembly, so that&apos;s probably why the code i showed you was mediocre.(?)
