					I usually choose what to do based on how much rom spacei have in my main code bank and what else i have going on. If i have plenty of cpu, then i use jumps and let the cpu do the math. I also sometimes just use lookup tables if i plan on adding many more options to the routine down the line. Easier to add a number to a lookup table rather than added a bunch more code and trying to rremember what i did to make it work weeks ago.
