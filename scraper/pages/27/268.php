		This is probably a Obscure Question and pretty sure it&apos;s been answered in Nerdy Nights but,<br>
		I wan&apos;t to change the controls from A and B to the Left and Right on the D-Pad. But i have completly no clue how and Nerdy Nights currently didn&apos;t help. I was wondering how to do it but (obviously) it&apos;s difficult to make it possible.</div>
	<br>
	What part of Nerdy Nights are you at?&#xA0; If you get to one of the later lessons, it starts using different controller code.<br>
	<br>
	Can you post what controller code you&apos;re currently using?<br>
	&#xA0;</div>
<br>
It doesn&apos;t really matter anymore now, I&apos;ve figure it out. I&apos;m sure i&apos;ll ask more questions here in the future.&#xA0;<br>
