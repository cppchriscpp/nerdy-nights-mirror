					This is pretty neat. I may neat to rewrite my NMI: I&apos;ve read Disch&apos;s document, but don&apos;t quite understand everything he does in it. I&apos;m hesitant to change my NMI right now, just cause it&apos;ll probably break my game since I don&apos;t understand what&apos;s all happening there yet.

<br>should a sound engine always go in the first bank? I&apos;m pretty sure the code runs banks in order, and since music can take a long time, you may always want the sound to run first.

<br>the .i files gave me some trouble at first, cause I couldn&apos;t open them with windows, so I made copies of them and converted them to .txt files so I could look at them in notepad. I can see what they&apos;re doing now, so I&apos;m pretty sure I can write a different tune to play. According to the sound_data.1, it&apos;s playing 17 ascending notes on the 3 channels then writing $FF which I assume is a flag to stop.
