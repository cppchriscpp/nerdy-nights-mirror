					whilst i LOVE these, as a musician and a super user of both ppmck and famitracker, there is a slight addition necessary to bring the power of volume envelopes to their fullest power: loops.
<br>
<br>now, i tried literally adding the loop code (found in future NNS) to no avail, so i&apos;m guessing this has to be implemented as part of the sound engine. is there a way to set yr sound env and then a loop point, which, instead of looping the last byte, loop a set of bytes?
<br>
<br>note: i&apos;m aware that this is a tall order and this is also a year and a half late.
