					I would think envelopes would be preference. The music, I&apos;m gonna use is pretty involved, and has envelopes and vibrato, etc. I&apos;ve been dying to try some roughed in tunes, but the engine hasn&apos;t been capable yet. 
<br>
<br>Looping probably more logical step, but some of the bells and whistles are needed for me personally to try out some of the music that is planned for my game. It uses a lot of duty cycle sweeps, and volume envelopes. If I had those, I should be able to at least put in some partial tunes and see how they play through the engine.
<br>
<br>So far though, must say, I&apos;m liking the versatility of the engine, and the simplicity of the song data.
