	Sorry to post on this one again, but I still cannot seem to get what is going on with the lesson. I moved onto lesson 9 and finished that with minimal problems (other than forgetting to JSR a subroutine, that took way too long to track down!), so I am anxious to get moving onto something else besides Pong.<br>
	<br>
	For this lesson, even basic things, such as why we are doing 16-bit math in the first place would be helpful, not to mention 32, 64, and higher math.<br>
	<br>
	Regarding the &quot;pointing&quot; to background data I am a bit too lost to even ask a good question. I have tried various ways of separating the background code from the pointer variables all to no avail. If anybody would be willing to dumb it down a shade I would greatly appreciate it. Perhaps part of the problem lies in the following questions, though perhaps not: in the way the lesson&apos;s code is structured, where exactly would the initialization for further backgrounds be inserted? I understand that the nametables come at the end, but the initialization code for the background itself occurs before the NMI. This probably leads into further questions about how to structure code, where NMI&apos;s are placed, what needs to be repeated for each game state and or room, etc. I am guessing that most of my problems surrounding switching game states and backgrounds are to be found in this lesson. Oh, and I have read and reread the article over at NESDEV regarding Frames and NMI&apos;s, and while interesting I could not find a way to implement it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>

Have you read MRN&apos;s tutorials?<br>
