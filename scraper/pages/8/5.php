					After the concrete goals of Lesson 7 (finally worked through most of them!), the assignment for this lesson baffles me. Primarily, what exactly is the task in lesson 8? The assignment is given of &quot;separating the code that sets the pointer variables from the code that copies the loop,&quot; with the goal being to devise a way to &quot;have multiple backgrounds that use different pointer loading code, but the same copy code.&quot; One respondent in the thread seemed to give indication that this was primarily asking one to turn part of the code into a subroutine, which would minimize the need to rewrite the copy code each time. Is this what is being asked for? A nudge in the right direction, or even a different phrasing for the task would be greatly appreciated. I am a bit unclear on the whole lesson to be honest, despite reading through it many times, so that may have something to do with my inability to figure out what is being asked.
