					Ok, I will not worry too much about the math thing until I need it. Regarding the separation of code, BunnyBoy&apos;s assignment was to:
<br>
<br>&quot;Your task is to separate out the code that sets the pointer variables from the code that copies the loop. That way you can have multiple backgrounds that use different pointer loading code, but the same copy code.&quot;
<br>
<br>I have tried to separate it out several different ways, in order to create some sort of subroutine (per 3Gens advice), but it never seems to load properly (lots of random tiles, flashing, etc.). I would not be so hung up on finishing it, but when I try to do a multi screen Pong (title, playing field, game over), I am unable to isolate the reusable portion of code and have to fully re-label each individual section in order to avoid assembler errors.
