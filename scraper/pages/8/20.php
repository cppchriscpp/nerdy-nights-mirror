					Thanks 3GenGames and thefox! It makes a bit more sense now. Don&apos;t have the full grasp of the [] yet, but what 3Gen mentions make sense to me. Adding a value to an address requires brackets, incrementing does not. IT&apos;s kind of like how Excel distinguishes a string from a value with quotes &quot;&quot;. Obviously, it not exactly the same, but the theory is the same and it&apos;s something I can relate the code to so it makes sense to me.
