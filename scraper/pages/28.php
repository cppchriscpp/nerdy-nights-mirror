					Hey Everyone,<br><br>I just wanted to share a horizontal background scrolling engine I&apos;ve been working on.&#xA0; I&apos;ve noticed a lot of other noobs besides myself asking about how to do this, so wanted to post this to hopefully help out.&#xA0; It&apos;s probably not the most effective way to handle background scrolling and buffering, it&apos;s just simply how I got it to work.&#xA0; I&apos;m sure there are improvements that can be made, and if anyone has them to suggest it would be awesome.<br><br>One area where I know improvements can be made is incorporating metatiles and data compression.&#xA0; The backgrounds are loaded in byte by byte and it can be a bit time-consuming making them and then re-arranging them to work with the buffer.&#xA0; Also, since I don&apos;t know how to use compression and each background takes up about 1K of memory, that only gives you about 31 backgrounds you can load in using this engine.&#xA0; Eh, who needs worlds 1-2 through 8-4 of Super Mario Bros, anyway?&#xA0; :-)<br><br>So think of it as &quot;beginner&apos;s&quot; scrolling engine, one that would hopefully be easier to understand by noobs such as myself.&#xA0; I was simply focused on getting something up and running, and then figuring out the more complicated stuff later.&#xA0; I&apos;m going to start studying said complicated stuff very shortly.&#xA0; <br><br>In the mean time, if anyone needs to look at something more advanced, you might check out Cadaver&apos;s more sophisticated scrolling engine that handles vertical and horizontal scrolling.&#xA0; It&apos;s excellent and can be found at nesdev (<a href="http://parodius.com/scroll.zip).&#xA0;" target="_blank" original-href="http://parodius.com/scroll.zip).&#xA0;">http://parodius.com/scroll.zip).&amp;...</a>; I&apos;ve been looking at it a little bit but haven&apos;t delved too deeply into the code, yet.<br><br>--Edit: Forgot to mention: hit left and right to scroll.&#xA0; Sorry.&#xA0; It&apos;ll stop you from scrolling any farther when you&apos;ve hit the left edge of first background or right edge of last background.<br><br>--Further Edit 5-19-10:&#xA0; I just noticed this has been posted to the Programming Resources sticky.&#xA0; Just so I don&apos;t confuse anyone who might be looking, I&apos;ve removed all earlier versions of this demo.&#xA0; It&apos;s gone through a lot of changes and the first few versions were not at all ideal.&#xA0; I will keep the most current, updated version posted at the top of the thread here to make it easier for people to find.<br>
