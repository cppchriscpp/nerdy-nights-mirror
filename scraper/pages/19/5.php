					<div class="FTQUOTE"><i>Originally posted by: <b>udisi</b></i><br><br>As I was saying I was looking at how you did the text strings, but I have a few questions about them to see if I can use the idea in my next game. Below is a screen shot from Wizardry and it uses the type of display I want to use.<img hspace="0" border="0" align="0" vspace="0" alt="0" src="scraper/images/07002427-CF1D-7AA0-005F77DB3C2E5350.JPG" original-src="http://www.nintendoagemedia.com/users/93/photobucket/07002427-CF1D-7AA0-005F77DB3C2E5350.JPG"><br><br>I want to split the screen with the red circles and be able to update the red lines within those circles independently.<br><br>The top left would be used for some picture graphics, top right would be some test like the example, and the bottom would be some status and inventory info. <br><br>1) Now your text loading doesn&apos;t load a bunch of tiles. it pretty much just loads &quot;playing&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot;, etc...so like maybe 10 tiles. I&apos;m wondering is there a limit to the amount of tiles I can load using your method, or will I run out of vblank time. Kinda like how you can only load 64 sprites per frame? <br><br>2) You don&apos;t load any other background besides the text in your tutorial, so the background just fills the other space with $00. I want to put a border in like in the example with the white lines. Can I load the border once, and then just update the lines within the border? I know I can make strings that start and terminate at the spots I want, but I don&apos;t know if I can have a static border or not? <br><br>Pretty much that&apos;s all I want to do. Have that static boarder, and then be able to use text/graphic strings to fill in the areas of the boarders independently. You&apos;re code seems like it can be modified to do such, but I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s any hardware limitations to it. <br></div><br><br>To answer question 1, yes you can run out of vblank time if you fill your buffer with too many tile writes.&#xA0; You will probably have to stagger all of your text writing across several frames.&#xA0; Write some tiles, wait for the next frames, write some more, wait til the next frame, write some more, etc until you&apos;ve written all the data you need to write.&#xA0; Use trial and error to figure out how many tiles you can safely write before you spill out of vblank.<br><br>Alternatively, if you don&apos;t mind the screen flashing black for a second, you can turn the PPU off, write everything at once and then turn it back on.&#xA0; If the PPU is off you don&apos;t have to pay attention to vblank at all (except for palette updates I think) so you can write as much to the screen in one go as you like.&#xA0; This would be an ok solution if the text inside the boxes wouldn&apos;t change after displaying it, like pressing the select button to load up a static stats screen.&#xA0; It would be a bad solution for something like a character selection screen, where pressing the d-pad left and right would select the next character and update the text with their individual stats.&#xA0; You&apos;d get an annoying black flash in between every character.<br><br>For question 2, yes you should be able to draw the border once and then just update the lines within the borders.&#xA0; As long as you don&apos;t draw something in the same space as the border, or turn off the PPU or mess with the scroll, it should stay put.<br>
