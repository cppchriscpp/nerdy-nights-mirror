					Hi,
<br>
<br>As the zip file is not downloadable, I tried to retrieve the values of E2, F2, E3, F3, G3, H3.
<br>
<br>Can someone tell me if these values are correct?
<br>
<br>;Octave 1
<br>A1 = $00    ;&quot;1&quot; means octave 1.
<br>As1 = $01   ;&quot;s&quot; means &quot;sharp&quot;
<br>Bb1 = $01   ;&quot;b&quot; means &quot;flat&quot;.  A# == Bb
<br>B1 = $02
<br>

<br>C2 = $03
<br>Cs2 = $04
<br>Db2 = $04
<br>D2 = $05
<br>

<br>Es2 = $07
<br>Fb2 = $07
<br>F2 = $08
<br>
<br>A2 = $0C
<br>As2 = $0D
<br>Bb2 = $0D
<br>B2 = $0E
<br>
<br>;Octave 3
<br>C3 = $0F
<br>Cs3 = $10
<br>Db3 = $10
<br>D3 = $11
<br>
<br>E3 = $12
