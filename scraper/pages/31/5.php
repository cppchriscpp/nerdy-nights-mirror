					Nice write-up!  I learned something new.  I remember watching David Crane talk about how he made Pitfall on the 2600, and I was amazed at all the clever mirroring and other tricks he did to achieve impressive graphics with very little memory usage. I wasn&apos;t aware the Blue Bomber was brought to life thanks to sprite layering, neat!
