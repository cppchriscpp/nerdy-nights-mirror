					Hey Folks,<br><br>Got it working on the top.&#xA0; Thanks again, Al!&#xA0; I&apos;m posting the new demo in case any other noobs like myself are messing around with scrolling/Sprite 0 split and need a working demo to reference for their own projects.<br><br>Also, this one doesn&apos;t have the updating counter on the scrolling bar, but I did get the better controller reading working on the demo with the status bar at the bottom, as well.&#xA0; So thanks for the help with controller input, Metalslime and Mario&apos;s Right Nut.&#xA0; That also helped me finally get a pause function working on the pong game I made.&#xA0; Woo-hoo!<br><br>Lastly, I took an hour and cleaned up my comments so they ACTUALLY reflected the code.&#xA0; Novel idea, I know.&#xA0; I will warn that the comments on the demo with status bar at the bottom have not been checked over and are inaccurate.&#xA0; The comments in this demo should be fine, though.<br>
