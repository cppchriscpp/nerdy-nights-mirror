					Ok, yeah. I was wanting to try and load the backgound circles once, and since the areas are smaller inside them I was thinking I may be able to do all the updates in them without turning off the ppu. That link you posted about in the sound tutorials about NMI, said something about using the buffer and never turning off NMI. 
<br>
<br>I would think I could save a lot of PRG space if I only have to .db a few lines instead of a whole screen full of tiles. You know, like loading say 50 tiles instead of 256. 
<br>
<br>I know all about the flash from the disable/enable of NMI. It happens in my BattleBall game cause that&apos;s the way the Neardy Nights showed you how to do it. Also, I&apos;m loading a full 256 tiles for every screen change, so I pretty much had no choice.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m just trying to plan out some more efficient ideas for my next game. If this works it&apos;ll save space and not have the screen flashes.
