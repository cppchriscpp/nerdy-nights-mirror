					Is there any way I can still get all the attachments for these tutorials? I got the first one a few weeks ago but they don&apos;t seem to be available anymore. I tried following along with this one but I only get one repeating note that changes if I disable different channels and I&apos;d like to compare. Thanks in advance.
