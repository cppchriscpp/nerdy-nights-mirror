					If you play guitar and bass by ear you&apos;ll be fine as long as you can identify what note you are playing on the fretboard (by the counting method <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0" style="display: none;"> ).  If you are playing a chord on the guitar, just figure out the individual notes one at a time.  There&apos;s no reason you&apos;d have to know the technical name of the chord to transpose from the guitar to the NES.
