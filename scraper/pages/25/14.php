					Yeah, you&apos;re right.  I didn&apos;t think about that.  So moot point on my part.  You couldn&apos;t list any higher than $7F anyway because anymore would spill over into another byte when multiplying by two.  I guess I&apos;ll cross that bridge if I ever come to it where I need more than 128 entries.  For now I&apos;m guessing you&apos;d just need to use different metatile indexes for the different levels and whatnot.
