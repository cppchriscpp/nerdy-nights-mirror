					Don&apos;t feel too bad about how you have the meta-tiles setup. My first implementation was *awful*. I would draw a tile, jump ahead 32 tiles to draw the second, jump back 31 tiles to draw the 3rd, then jump ahead another 32 to draw the 4th. The only reason it didn&apos;t bring the game to a screeching halt is because buffered the writes into ram...
