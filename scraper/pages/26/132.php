<p>Anyone have a slick hack for taking a byte and separate 5 bits on one side and the other 3 bits as well?</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p> I saw where some were talking about swaping nibbles. This is also usefull for taking 11111111 and producing 00001111 and 11110000 but shifting it down to be 00001111.</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p> The the 5 /3 one would be like taking 11111111 and producing 00011111 and 00000111 out of it with minimal cycles used.</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>just curious.</p>
