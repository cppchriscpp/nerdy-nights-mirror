<p>Yeah, well that&apos;s even further before my time than the 1960&apos;s.</p>

<p>BTW, I developed an interesting method for doing long division which would be really cool if someone hadn&apos;t patented the same thing shortly before (and unbeknownst to me).  It would be especially useful for performing really huge divisions on machines with a fast multiply but slow divide.</p>
