					First of all thanks for the great tutorial.<br>
<br>
There is a slight typo&#xA0;:<br>
&#xA0;
<div class="FTQUOTE">
	Base 2 binary works the same way, except each digit can be 0-1 and the place values are powers of 2 instead of 10. Insert a 0 to the right of a number and it becomes 2 times bigger. Remove a 0 and it becomes <span style="color: #ff0000">10 times </span>smaller.</div>
<br>
<br>
It must be &quot;2 times&quot; not 10 times. For example :<br>
<br>
1110b = 14d<br>
111b = 7d<br>
<br>
1010b = 10d<br>
101b = 5d<br>
<br>
As you can see removing 0 from right makes the number only 2 times smaller not 10 times.<br>
