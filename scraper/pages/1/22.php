					Thanks for posting this information. I can&apos;t imagine how many countless hours was spent figuring all this out. I&apos;m thinking about learning all I can about the NES programming in hopes of possibly creating my own NES game someday but even if I don&apos;t I find it fascinating to see a basic concept of how the games I grew up playing actually worked.
