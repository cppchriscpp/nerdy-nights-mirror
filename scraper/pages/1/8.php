					Well, I finally got a chance to go through and read this. It looks good so far Brian. A few questions:
<br>
<br>1 - In scientific mode on windows calculator, what is the &quot;Oct&quot; number system? I&apos;m just curious about this really.
<br>
<br>2 - Can&apos;t binary represent letters as well? For example, on <a href="http://www.nickciske.com/tools/binary.php" target="_blank">this site</a> you can convert binary to text and back again, which can hold letters, numbers, and punctuation.
<br>
<br>3 - In assembly language, can variables be named anything? For example, would &quot;MarioHorizPosition&quot; be a valid name for a variable? What are the naming restrictions?
