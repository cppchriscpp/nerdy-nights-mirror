	First of all thanks for the great tutorial.<br>
	<br>
	There is a slight typo&#xA0;:<br>
	&#xA0;
	<div class="FTQUOTE">
		Base 2 binary works the same way, except each digit can be 0-1 and the place values are powers of 2 instead of 10. Insert a 0 to the right of a number and it becomes 2 times bigger. Remove a 0 and it becomes <span style="color: #ff0000">10 times </span>smaller.</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	It must be &quot;2 times&quot; not 10 times. For example :<br>
	<br>
	1110b = 14d<br>
	111b = 7d<br>
	<br>
	1010b = 10d<br>
	101b = 5d<br>
	<br>
	As you can see removing 0 from right makes the number only 2 times smaller not 10 times.</div>
<br>
<br>
I&apos;m thinking this was a binary joke (since %10 = 2).&#xA0; Maybe a tutorial on binary isn&apos;t the best place for it but chances are if you&apos;re prepared to program the NES you&apos;ve had some exposure to binary already.<br>
