					<div class="FTQUOTE"><i>Originally posted by: <b>bunnyboy</b></i><br><br>I would expect the apology to be for deleting all his posts</div><br>Am I in minority for thinking he shouldn&apos;t have to apologize? Was there any need for all the negativity right from the beginning?  Since deleteme started posting in this thread, his post count has doubled.  I wouldn&apos;t call that a positive contribution to the community.  It would have been quite possible for deleteme to criticize without being an ass about it.  I can understand why you would be a little peeved, since the Nerdy Nights are &quot;your baby&quot;.<br><br>Regardless, it is still helpful, thanks MRN for this info and Bunny for all the help you guys give to us meager homebrewers.
