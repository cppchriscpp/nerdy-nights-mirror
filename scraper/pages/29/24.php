					Yeah, if we can split the posts off, I&apos;d like to talk about that. I think deleteme brought up good points, but was a dick about it to start with. I read his posts and thought, &quot;damn... dickish!,&quot; but bunny brings up great points about it. Either someone starting a new topic, or splitting the last couple of posts here would be great. I think discussion about how info is presented about development would benefit all of us.
