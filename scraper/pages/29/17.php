					Wow all that to avoid an simple apology, and yet still the tutorial has problems!  
<br>A: INES header mirror info is wrong
<br>B:  nothing about batt ram
<br>C: still doesnt explain about the reset
<br>D: wrong caps on kb
<br>e: misspelled words
<br>F: doesnt explain bits7,6,5
<br>G: etc etc etc
<br>why miss the chance to make it better?  At least BunnyBoy fixes his shit when an error is found...
<br>
<br>&quot;Someone will help me out if there are any mistakes.&quot; and when help came it was deleted.  Will you take the help now?
