					I wouldn&apos;t necessarily say he was &quot;piggy backing.&quot;  He just wrote up a helpful guide for me that had to do with background compression.  Its focus being NES programming, it makes sense to me to just use the same name that other NES programming tutorials were using.
<br>
<br>There was no intent to do nothing but help promote the NES dev scene by doing these posts.  He started the post with a disclaimer to let people know that it wasn&apos;t promised to be 100% accurate.  I don&apos;t see anything wrong with that.
<br>
<br>If you are programming your own game and used his tutorials here and they somehow messed up what you were doing I could understand the hostility here, but I don&apos;t see any harm with his coming in here trying to write a guide for someone less informed (me) to use.
<br>
<br>He just used the Nerdy Nights name because that&apos;s what people have been calling their NES dev turorials.  Did Metal Slime ask permission to use the NN name when he did his music tutorials?  I don&apos;t know this answer, but I don&apos;t see people hounding him about stuff.
<br>
<br>Relax.  This was all done with the sole purpose to help others.
