					First, I appoligize to the community as a whole for &quot;deleting shit&quot;.  I have received more than one tounge lashing over it, so if it&apos;s all the same to everyone, I consider the matter closed.
<br>
<br>My problem was not with the criticizm, but with how it was presented.  It goes back to what my mommy tells me, &quot;If you are an ass to someone, expect an asshole in return.&quot;  Constructive criticism is very different than implying that someone doesn&apos;t know what they are doing.  Making posts that will quite obviously start a flame war = bad.  
<br>
<br>If someone feels like editing my little write up and PMing or emailing it back to me, I&apos;d be happy to fix it.  However, I don&apos;t want to sort through this mess to find what is actually helpful.  
<br>
<br>Bunnyboy, in the future, if you have a problem with something that I am doing, I would hope that it won&apos;t take 6 months and an epic flame war for you to let me know what&apos;s up.  I consider us friends and hope that we can get past this.  You have my email addy, my AIM info, and you could even PM me...I won&apos;t tell.  <img src="images/blank.gif" border="0" style="display: none;" original-src="/media/_images/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif">  I removed my smart ass title to my threads and would be honered if you would help me to fix the problems in this one, the other one, and any future ones that I might post.  If it&apos;s okay with you, I will add a reference to your thread on MMC1 in this write up somewhere.  I feel that we both present the material from different view points that could help a potential user understand the process.  If you would like to expand/repair whatever issues you see in my compression thread, that&apos;d be cool.  Or if you&apos;d like to write your own, that would be okay as well.  
<br>
<br>I&apos;d like to remain buds so that I can bug you when I have an issue as I value you as a resource and as a friend.
<br>
<br>Peace.
