					Yes, MetalSlime did ask and was given permission.  He also sent me his first few tutorials so I could read and edit them.  Changes were made to make his stuff match the series and make them more complete.  He also really understands the entire audio system instead of still being a a self described noob.
<br>
<br>The problem is these tutorials are buggy and incomplete.  As deleteme said before it was erased, things like &quot;Not sure what these do&quot; should never be in a tutorial.  Previously I let things like that go because any tutorials are helpful.
<br>
<br>But now since there has been no notice that all the deletion even happened, no explanation for removing valid content, and no apology to deleteme I am now requesting that nobody use the Nerdy Nights name without contacting me and having complete tutorials.  This isn&apos;t to stop anything from being posted, just use your own name instead.  Of course I can&apos;t actually enforce this and likely won&apos;t bother trying.  To clear up the gaps in this specific tutorial another one will be posted.
