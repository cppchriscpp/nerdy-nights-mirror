					Thanks for the help Al.  I changed the kB, I think I got all of them.
<br>
<br>But on the bits, I think that our friend here meant bits 7, 6, and 5 of the &quot;Control&quot; not the &quot;Load Register&quot; (as nesdev wiki puts it).  But I will add that part about the load register that you pointed out.  Thanks!
