					This is pretty cool.  Thanks for the info.  For some reason, on my computer here, it looks like all of your paragraphs are in one line of text and you have to scroll way right off the screen to read the whole thing.  Is that a setting I have messed up?

<br>Any chance of expanding this to include SUROM?  I&apos;ve made it work, but it is not pretty.
