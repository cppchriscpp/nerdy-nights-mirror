<br>Alright, I wasn&apos;t sure if NESASM was greatly expanded on or not since it was going from 2.xx to ver 3. I was just curious : )  I had a great deal of help getting ca65 setup though, which at first I had used p65. I&apos;ll look up ASM6 to see what that&apos;s all about, thanks!

<br>It&apos;s more like a demo, but... I don&apos;t know, it&apos;s not really a game, but not really a demo haha It&apos;s something to get my feet wet for the most part. You can get the latest upload here:

<br>It&apos;s a bit further along than that now. Different title screen, the cat sprite tiles are pulled onto the screen, and the checkmark on the notepad in the bottom left actually stop at each selection instead of moving up and down really fast haha You&apos;ll also notice that when you come back from the instruction screen in this upload, that the little &quot;Decepticon looking cat-head&quot; is in the wrong spot. That&apos;s fixed also.
<br>
<br>Right now I&apos;m trying to come up with a better controller routine using EORs and ANDs (something recommended to me, now I just have to figure it out). Also, changing sprites when the button is pressed. That&apos;s a whole different issue. Anyway, yeah, you can check it out in the link above. Not much, but at least I&apos;m learning : )
