<br>
<br>I&apos;m new to this, so these may be dumb questions.
<br>
<br>In background.asm
<br>
<br>In the vblankwait1: section
<br>What does BIT and BPL mean?
<br>
<br>In the clrmem: section
<br>You increment x and then branch if not equal
<br>I thought you had to do some kind of comparison on the line before BNE
<br>What is the BNE comparing to? What values must be equal to continue and not jump back to clrmem:?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Thanks</div><br>BNE will cause a branch if the result is not zero, right? <br><br>Oh, and you probably shouldn&apos;t listen to anything I say. I&apos;m about a half-step above NoobExtreem(TM). Okay, I&apos;m going to stop posting now. Bye. <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0" style="display: none;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br>
