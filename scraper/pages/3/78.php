Either way.&#xA0; Thanks guys.&#xA0; As I&apos;ve said elsewhere on these boards.&#xA0; Every little insight is a step forward that keeps me from giving up and the support this board has shown myself and others I see struggling is very uplifting.&#xA0; I think I have enough understanding that a little research will get me started on a simple thing to boost morale.&#xA0; Even if I can&apos;t do the &quot;from scratch&quot; method yet, two player controlled sprites running around the screen is a sure start.<br>
<br>
p.s.&#xA0; Is it considered kosher on these boards to post &quot;junk&quot; roms of our progress?<br>
&#xA0;</div>
<br>
Go ahead and do it. It is appreciated to post any kinds of homebrew ROMs IMO<br>
