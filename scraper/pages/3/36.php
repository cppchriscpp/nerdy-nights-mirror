					Would anyone know the reason why, when I make a save state on fcgeux, that the colors turn from green, where I have it now;
<br>
<br>  LDA #%11000000   ;intensify blues
<br>  STA $2001
<br>
<br>Back to a dull gray.
<br>I don&apos;t yet know how to bring the new save state back into a format that I can analyze in a text document like the original asm to see what has changed either...
<br>
<br>You guys rock the rocks, btw.
<br>Cheers!
