					<p>Hi Bunnyboy,</p><p>&#xA0;I dont know if its my browser, but I notice a lot of the code snippets above are showing up altogether on the same line.&#xA0;&#xA0; So if I was to copy and paste those into a file,&#xA0; it obviously wouldnt compile.</p><p>The only other comment I would make would be mentioning something about CONSTANTS or DEFINES</p><p>I can see that you have some declared for PPUMASK, etc.. in the code&#xA0; but there is no separate heading for them like you have for COMMENTS and OPERANDS.&#xA0; That threw me for a loop since the syntax is slightly different for those constants between different assemblers.</p><p>Keep up the good work</p><p>Al</p>
