					Those are opcodes, you should get an assembly manual for the 6502.  I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a complete one online somewhere.  BIT tests bits in the accumuluator.  BPL means branch result plus.  It checks the status of flag N.  If you don&apos;t know what that means, it&apos;s highly recommended you read through a 6502 Assembly book.  I believe Zaks did one awhile ago that&apos;s quite good.  Not familiar with it, but I Have his Z80 Assembly book and it&apos;s boss.
