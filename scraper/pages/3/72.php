					LOL.  Man.  I can see why people wanted to simplify it.  Assembly is seriously a lot different than anything I have ever worked with so far.  Again.  It&apos;s just hard to grasp how number transferring produces these results.  Almost like trying to visualize in pure binary.  So now that I have the actual coding a little more in place, I should probably work more on the architecture and the specifics of memory locations?
