					Found a tiny typo:
<br>
<br>&quot;Accumulator
<br>The Accumulator (A) is the main 8 bit register for loading, storing, comparing, and doing math on data. Some of the most frequent operations are:
<br>LDA #$FF  ;load the hex value $FF (decimal 256) into A
<br>STA $0000 ;store the accumulator into memory location $0000, internal RAM&quot;
<br>
<br>It should read decimal 255, not 265. great TUT so far.
