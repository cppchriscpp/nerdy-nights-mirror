					How can I make a NES ROM to support right to left language?
<br>I don&apos;t have any problem for translating fixed text on the screen but texts which gradually appear from left to right, are really hard to translate.
<br>Captain Tsubasa Arabic translation is a good example for this matter.
<br>I guess I have to do it in assembly 6502 but I don&apos;t have any idea how to do it?
<br>I appreciate anyone who can help me.
<br>
<br>Also some other nice people guide me but I really need some more help :
