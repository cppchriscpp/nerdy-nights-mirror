					Thanks for the reply.  Is 16KB the maximum the prg rom can be?  I was under the impression it could be a maximum of 32KB with 4 8K banks.  Also why are things arranged in 8K banks?  Is this just how NESASM likes to do it, or does the hardware need it that way for some reason.

<br>Sorry for all the questions, but I would like to get this down before I move on.  Thanks again.
