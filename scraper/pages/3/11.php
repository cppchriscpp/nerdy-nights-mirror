					Hi,
<br>
<br>I&apos;m new to this, so these may be dumb questions.
<br>
<br>In background.asm
<br>
<br>In the vblankwait1: section
<br>What does BIT and BPL mean?
<br>
<br>In the clrmem: section
<br>You increment x and then branch if not equal
<br>I thought you had to do some kind of comparison on the line before BNE
<br>What is the BNE comparing to? What values must be equal to continue and not jump back to clrmem:?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Thanks
