<br>It seems to be able to make fairly simple games without too much problem.  I&apos;ve not tried anything more sophisticated like mapper use.  What specifically do you want to do?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Side note:  NESASM has a tendency to be bashed for being a bad assembler.  It&apos;s a good teaching assembler, I suppose, but for any future projects, I&apos;m going to look at others and see if they truly are better.</begin></div>

<br>Well, I was using a different assembler before (was learning it). NESASM wasn&apos;t at version 3 before, so I was wondering what has been done to it. Like you said, it&apos;s supposed to be pretty good for smaller games, so I was going to check out what it can do in terms of macros and the like (if at all). Anyway, I&apos;m sure I&apos;m going to stick with what I&apos;m using now, which is ca65, but I&apos;m curious to know what has been tweaked in NESASM.
