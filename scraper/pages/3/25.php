					Unzip the background.zip file.
<br>Open a DOS window.
<br>change into that background folder
<br>
<br>type the following:
<br>dir
<br>
<br>
<br>There should be 3 files
<br>background.asm
<br>background.bat
<br>mario.chr
<br>
<br>type:
<br>background.bat
<br>
<br>It should complain: &apos;NESASM3&apos; is not recognized as an internal or external command
<br>
<br>Update background.bat to include the entire path to nesasm (be aware that you may need quotes if there are spaces in the path).
<br>
<br>Alternativly, add nesasm to your sytem &quot;PATH&quot; variable.
<br>to do this:
<br>Open your &quot;Control Panel&quot;  and click on &quot;System&quot;.  to open &quot;System Properties&quot;
<br>In &quot;System Properties&quot; find the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab.  and click on the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; button.
<br>Find an item entitled &quot;PATH&quot;  and edit it to add the path to your nesasm (you probably should add this at the end, and remember to add a semi colon before you enter the path)
<br>
<br>If this all works, and nesasm is working, you should see your  background.nes file being created.
<br>Double click the NES file and your emulator should load it.
