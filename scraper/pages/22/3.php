					question from five years later: how can I change the duty to the noise channel?
<br>
<br>In famitracker you can change the noise channel duty (00 or 010). I tried changing the duty via opcode, either by increasing the duty increment by one or by 16, nothing besides a different note (instead of a C noise it&apos;s an F noise, but increasing by all sorts of odd numbers doesn&apos;t give me the sound I get from a duty change in Fami)
<br>
<br>Is there a way to do this or am I forcing a famitracker feature on an in game music engine?
