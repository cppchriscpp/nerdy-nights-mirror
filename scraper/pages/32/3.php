					You will have to have a ROM or CHR file to open. There are basic ones included with other tutorials, in case you do not have any accessible. Then it is just a straightforward process of opening the file. You will see a garbled mess when opening most files (PRG data I am told; thanks MRN), but if you scroll down a ways youwillmbegin to see graphics data. Try that and report back if that does not solve it. I may be misunderstanding the question <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>.
<br>
<br>Also PLEASE NOTE: if you make changes to a ROM, well, you&apos;ve changed it! Use copies of things when saving. Unless of course you want to change the graphics in a game, but I have not messed around with that so my experience is nil on that front.
