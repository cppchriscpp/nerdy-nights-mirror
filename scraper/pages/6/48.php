					Did I mention that this site rocks because of the people here. I can tell this is definitely visited by true enthusiasts, and that alone is very exciting. Both of you seem pretty seasoned in this stuff, so thanks for the time to make the replies for us new guys. =) <br><br>Zzap, that makes sense, Guess I just needed to talk it out and hear it. <br><br>3GenGames, First sentence, got it. So if Mario hits the block (part of the background), it &quot;produces&quot; a sprite such as the mushroom via some code. Which is probably why the mushroom is in the sprite pattern table. Also, what I meant by no background was no attribute / colors just flat black $0F (like Galaga). The other reason I was asking&#xA0;and you already addressed with SMB3 comment. I&apos;m just thinking &quot;is it easier to have collision detection between a sprite and background, or sprite and sprite?&quot; So when Mario hits a block (background) there is collision detection obviously. And if a mushroom sprite is produced, and Mario grabs it, there is also collision detection. So which is easier sprite-to-sprite collision detection or sprite-to-background...or does it matter, they are the same? <br><br>Just planning ahead, as to which one I want to make. The bricks are obviously already part of the background, so its the more &quot;standard&quot; way of doing it. I just like to think outside the box and see what other options are there, and maybe understand a bit more on the &quot;why&quot; it is the standard. <br><br>Hope that makes sense. <br>Thanks for the PM offer, I&apos;ll probably take you up on it when I&apos;m &quot;stuck&quot; on an actual line of code, haha.&#xA0;Right now, I just have background of some SMB tiles and mario sprite that I can move around. <br><br>Still getting the feet wet. =) <br><br>OS <br>
