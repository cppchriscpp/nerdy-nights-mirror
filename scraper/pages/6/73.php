					Yikes.  Guess I&apos;ll have to keep looking then. As for the NMI acknowledgement I&apos;m not sure what you mean. Do you mean turning off the screen and then re-enabling?  If so, where else is it helpful to do so?  In reference to the first comment that will be an easy fix. I know what bit does that every time a point is scored. I noticed the flashing myself and just hadn&apos;t fixed it yet.
