					I seem to be having trouble with this. for some reason my code displays 4 pink blocks on a black background while BunnyBoy&apos;s will display mario with bricks and sky and whatnot. can someone point out to me where in my code it is incorrect. I&apos;m not asking for exact reason just where the problem is occurring in the code.

<br>[Edit] <br><br>&#xA0;deleted all the code on the page since it was just taking up space on the thread.<br><br><br>[EDIT]<br>&#xA0;
I forgot to put this in the code which kept the sprites from loading. lol<br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0; .bank 2<br>
&#xA0; .org $0000<br>
&#xA0; .incbin &quot;mario.chr&quot;<br><br>I spent nearly 4 hours going over my code to realize that I was missing this little piece. lol<br>
