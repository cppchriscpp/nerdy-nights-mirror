					If you turn the screen on whilst the frame is basicly halfway down the screen for example (the nes keeps generating sync signals etc...and stil sends out some video data like the backround colour) it&apos;ll cause it to start rendering the first scanline right there and then. Causing the picture to &quot;jump&quot;. So what you do is you wait for nmi THEN turn the screen on so you don&apos;t get the jump.
