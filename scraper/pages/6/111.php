<strong>How many NES homebrewers actually save a full nametable in the ROM for each background in the game?</strong></div>
If you are not targetting cart production, then ROM space is completely free so I don&apos;t bother with compression.<br>

If you are targetting carts, then I only use compression to hit important ROM sizes like 128KB and 512KB. &#xA0;The same chip is used for 80KB and 128KB so smaller data frequently doesn&apos;t matter. &#xA0;I have done compression for CHR (8KB-&gt;3-5KB) and RLE for dragon warrior type maps, but I don&apos;t think I have done it for nametables.
