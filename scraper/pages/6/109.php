	<strong>How many NES homebrewers actually save a full nametable in the ROM for each background in the game?</strong><br>
	&#xA0;</div>
<br>
The compression method you&apos;re describing is definitely the better way to go, and I use this method for gameplay background data and other areas.&#xA0; But for things like Title screens, credit screens, etc, I use the method I described.&#xA0; It&apos;s super easy to go back, open the nametable in NES Screen Tool, make a change, and export the new background.&#xA0; Then I never even have to go into my code to update it.&#xA0; It&apos;s already changed automatically.<br>
<br>
And it makes a lot more sense to try to explain this method to a beginner.&#xA0; Someone who is just trying to figure things out would have a hard time trying to grasp background compression.&#xA0; That&apos;s something that is adapted later.<br>
