					A last question! is there any way that I could use the patern tables tiles in a image format? 
<br>
<br>I mean, now I fully understand this tutorial, but to proove myself that I really understand it, I want to make a custom background with the tiles of Mario Bros background pattern table/tiles. As a visual support I would like to do something that I see to be accurate. Does some one understand what I mean? 
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not sure if I express really well what I want but I hope some one will.
