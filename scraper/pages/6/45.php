					New guy here, thought after 2 months of reading this stuff and doing well in the tutorials that I would make it all the way through to the last topic, but got stuck on a question I&apos;m not getting. So joined up the NA site so I could post my question and start participating. <br><br>Anyway, I&apos;m having difficulty determining what should be a &quot;sprite&quot;, and what should be in the &quot;background&quot;. Or what the real difference is anyway. <br><br>For example, in SMB, the clouds and bricks are both background (Pattern Table 1) correct? But Mario interacts (collision) with some background tiles like the bricks and some other background tiles not at all, like the clouds. So I&apos;m trying to see if there is a good definition for a sprite vs background tiles. The only thing I can tell really is that sprites have 4 attributes, only 2 of which differ it from a background tile (such as flipping it). Color palette and location are both set, etc....<br><br>Just trying to think ahead for certain situations like: <br>1. I may have more sprites than I can fit onto 1 Pattern Table of 1 .chr file. (Just make more chr files a solution?) <br>2. I may not have a background at all, so I would want both Pattern Tables for sprites (maybe Pac Man or Galaga has no background?) <br><br>Just thoughts, maybe I&apos;m way off, any kind words are welcome as this is my first post =) <br><br>OS <br><br>
