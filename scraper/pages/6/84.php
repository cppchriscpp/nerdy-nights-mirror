					I understand that a sprite gets 3 colors + transparent, and that the colors in the background within a certain area all need to use the same palette. I have the attributes for the background all set to be the same. but for some reason instead of the background having a pale pink color it turns green. I only have green for sprites not the background. and when I change the sprite colors it changes the background. The bricks around the sky are the right color but the sky tile is not. and that&apos;s where I&apos;m getting confused.
