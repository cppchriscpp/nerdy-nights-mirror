					alright so I&apos;m having a brain dead moment. I got the background to fully load (haven&apos;t tweeks the attributes as of yet but wil get there soon) but I can&apos;t figure out why at the top it goes halfway with sky, then the bricks start. based on what I&apos;ve read there should be some sky all the way across the top then the next row the bricks would start. can someone please explain to me why this is happening?<br>
<br>
(my basic plan is to encompass the border with bricks when all is said and done. I also realize I&apos;ve got my brick tops and bottoms reversed. will fix later)<br>
<br>
i&apos;ve atached a picture and the code<br>
