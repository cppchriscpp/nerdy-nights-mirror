					I studied this particular tutorial and it finally makes sense.  Basically I was reading the attribute byte like a sprite attribute, so only manipulating the last two bits.  I now understand that there are 8 bits, and split up into 4 2-bit chunks gives one byte control over one block (16x16 pixel section).  For some reason I didn&apos;t fully understand this before.
