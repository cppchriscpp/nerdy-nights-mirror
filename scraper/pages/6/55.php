					Attribute tables are really confusing me, I have a question.
<br>
<br>You mention the following:
<br>
<br>Two bits of the attribute table byte are assigned to each 2x2 area.
<br>
<br>From your image example it seems that two bits of the byte are used per tile and not 2 per 2x2 tile area - that would be 8 bits from what I see?
<br>
<br>I must be looking at this completely wrong, any help would be greatly appreciated.
