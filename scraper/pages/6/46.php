					The sprites can all move independently, and have pixel accuracy. You can have up to 64 8x8 or 8x16 sprites (max 8 per scanline).
<br>
<br>The background can only move as one whole background, while it is possible to update tiles in the background each frame, there is a limit to how many tiles you can replace per frame.
