					Sprite color 0 is never used in any sprite palette and all the color entries that go into $3F00,$3F04,$3F08,$3F0C,$3F10,$3F14,$3F18,$3F1C have to be the same as the background color*, sprites only get 3 colors, it looks like you&apos;re trying to use 4.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:8px;">* They don&apos;t have to be unless you know more how the hardware works, but in these tutorials, keep them the same.</span>
