					@Kevin, bunnyboy, Kalle, Beau
<br>Thank you, really interesting reading from some more experienced homebrewers. Exactly what I was looking for as answers to that questions. I consider myself way more talented as a game designer (game concepts, mechanics, and such things) rather than as a good programmer (I learned to program because is needed to develop an idea I have for a game), so when more experienced programmers talk, I am always interested into it, no matter that I&apos;m already skilled enough to understand, or I still need to chew on what I am explained a bit more to fully understand what I am told.
<br>
<br>So, thank you for your detailed opinions and proposed alternatives, I&apos;ll surely care about read them more then once and understand further the advantages/disadvantages of each. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
<br>
<br>Nice to know that anyways there is not a &quot;correct way&quot;: it seems, from these first replies, that it is more like &quot;it depends&quot; on various factors, as often is in many creative fields.

<br>&quot;&quot;&quot; And it makes a lot more sense to try to explain this method to a beginner.  Someone who is just trying to figure things out would have a hard time trying to grasp background compression.  That&apos;s something that is adapted later. &quot;&quot;&quot;
<br>
<br>Indeed. I was talking now on a right next level, for my own interest, giving as done that your previous link fully solved Bullseye needs (which is what I guess). <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
<br>
<br>Thanks All! <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
