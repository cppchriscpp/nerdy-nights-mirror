					Hi, thanks again for all the answer, they were really helpful! 
<br>
<br>I got a very last question. I finally menage to understand very well this tutorial. But as a challenge to myself, I want to make a background out of my imagination with the background tiles of the Mario bros. file. 
<br>
<br>My question is, Is there a way that I could use the tiles/background patern table from the Mario bros file, and make a visual support with it. The goal is to make a visal reference that help me to be more accurate, like a image(jpeg or something like that). I know its a lot of trouble but I think it could be very helpful to me.
