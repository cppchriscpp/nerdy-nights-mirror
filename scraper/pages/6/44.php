					Well you can only have 8KB of tiles in total. 4K for the front and 4K for the back. To get more you use a mapper, you can mostly only use a 8KB bank at a time. Then basically you can just make each file 8KB and include them all in the program. But you&apos;ll have to have your game switch them to utilize them.
<br>
<br>To make a new file of the size you want (it should be an even number like 8K,16K,32K,64K,128K,256K etc.) and then start making the graphics. If you need the program to create a blank file, I have one just PM me. With eath 8KB bank, you can select which ones go on the background and which goes to the sprites.
<br>
<br>And the assembler doesn&apos;t care what the background grahics are, the games program does and &quot;knows&quot; all it needs to know. The assembler just shoves the graphics in after the program, it doesn&apos;t do anything to them. It doesn&apos;t need to know which tile is what, it just assembles your ROM. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
