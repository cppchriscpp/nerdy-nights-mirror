					Hmmmmmmm... I still can&apos;t figure out how to create more than half a screen&apos;s-worth of background. &gt;.&lt;<br><br>Here is my entire background.asm file:
<a href="http://nintendoage.pastebin.com/m4f0e06ef" target="_blank" original-href="http://nintendoage.pastebin.com/m4f0e06ef">http://nintendoage.pastebin.com/m...</a><br><br>I&apos;d include a screenshot, but it&apos;s basically the same as the one I posted before, just with proper colors, and with four 16&#xD7;16-pixel rows of plain blue sky above what&apos;s already in my former screenshot. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>So -- anyway. What do I do to load a FULL background, instead of just half of it? \o_O/ Anyone? &gt;.&gt;?
