					Ahhh, yeah, that was it -- forgot to update that. ^^;
<br>
<br>Now it works; I doubled its value to $FF. <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-happy.gif" border="0" style="display: none;"> Now there&apos;s two rows of sky above the blocks, and one below them. The weird thing is, now the blocks are green. o.O I also changed the CPX value in LoadAttribute (doubled it from $08 to $10), but that didn&apos;t seem to do anything. &gt;.&gt; (also quadrupled the LoadAttribute CPX value -- now the zeroes below the bottom sky-row have mixed-up colors! <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-happy.gif" border="0" style="display: none;">) I happened to double (actually, duplicate) the &apos;attribute&apos; data, so I dunno what&apos;s going wrong with the colors. o.o&apos;
<br>
<br>Also, (I&apos;m guessing due to the fact that $FF is only 255, not 256,) for some reason the bottom-right corner in the last block on the bottom row of sky has a 0 in it, instead of being blank blue. o.O
