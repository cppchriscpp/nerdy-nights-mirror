					ohh i see, you have to scroll all the way to the bottom to make it $53-$56(which also makes the numbers the first things on the screen in yy-chr). So I guess the numbers are where the background tiles knows to start. And i guess the assembler just knows this when it loads the background. Im still kind of confused on what i would do if i wanted more tiles then this mario.chr has tho. then how would it know where the background started?
