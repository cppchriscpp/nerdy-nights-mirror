					thanks for the tips. I was tweaking with the code and ended up deleting it so i decided to DL the one I uploaded. turns out the code I attached was my code from last year that NA kept on file. lol I did realize that in my background 2,3,and 4 sections I had 1 too many .db in there. I had 9 instead of 8 So I think I might have been over loading the RAM or something.<br>
<br>
--------------EDIT--------------<br>
<br>
figured it out. I forgot to reset the high/low latch before engading the background loops.&#xA0; but the extra .db probably didn&apos;t help either. Now to get it to look the way I want.
