					I can certainly respect and appreciate the suggestions on restructuring my code, because if I expect any help my code should be well-organized and readable so that it&apos;s easier to spot bugs. I&apos;ve split my code up into 3 files: main game logic, subroutines, and data. I&apos;ve tried to comment my code as much as possible to make it evident what each block does. I guess what&apos;s really throwing me here is the issue that KHAN pointed out...if the attributes are set to zero, everything is fine. Even a switch to a non-zero value to change what palette set is being used will cause that overflow effect which I can&apos;t reconcile.<br>

EDIT: P.S. I promise I will simplify a LOT of the subroutine code tomorrow since I just learned in that Usage file for NESASM that you can create user-defined functions.&#xA0; I am giddy.
