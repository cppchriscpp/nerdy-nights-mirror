	Hi, it&apos;s been a couple of week since I&apos;m following those tutorial, there so great and make me feel close to my dream of making my own NES game week after week.<br>
	<br>
	I have a couple of questions, I know that this tutorial is showing how do to generate background/ nametables manually but, you mention that there &apos;&apos;is Some graphics tools [that] will generate this data&apos;&apos;. I would like to know:<br>
	1) do you really do that method manually everytime you make a game or are you actually using a graphics tools like you mention that help you generate your nametable? the point is that I consider myself more an artist than a hard programmer. if you just could show me a program that could help me saving effort of hard coding something that I litteraly don&apos;t see.<br>
	2) If you use that kind of program, does it run on Window 8? or is there any that run on Window 8?</div>
<br>
Unfortunately, you have to program everything yourself. However, you can program tools that help you with that, like compression routines (Metatile-based, AKA 16x16 tiles for example).<br>
I even programmed a program for the NES that makes it easier to make screens, but it involves a lot of programming knowledge to use it unfortunately<br>
<br>
EDIT: Oh lookie! It&apos;s an old thing by me when I did the NN for the first time. Time flies by so fast <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_tongue"></span>
