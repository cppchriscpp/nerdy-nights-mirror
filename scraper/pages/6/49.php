					Ha, okay man. But sprite on sprite background detection is pretty easy, I&apos;d say the background is little harder, especially if you edit it at all. But I mean it&apos;s a good idea to me just not to mess with that out of the gate unless your project needs it, you can always work up to it later in the project or with another game. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
