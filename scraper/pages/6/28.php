					OK thanks.&#xA0; I googled &apos;indirect indexed&apos; to read more info about this since the explanation on the page I linked above wasn&apos;t very helpful.&#xA0; I found this page which explains it better I think: <br><br><a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/roots/chapter_6.php" target="_blank">http://www.atariarchives.org/root...</a><br><br>I now understand what is going on.&#xA0; It is the declaration of AddrHigh and AddrLow as zero page variables that allows indirect indexing to work.&#xA0; Thanks everyone again for your help! &#xA0;
