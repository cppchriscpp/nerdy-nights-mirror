	My question is, Is there a way that I could use the tiles/background patern table from the Mario bros file, and make a visual support with it. The goal is to make a visal reference that help me to be more accurate, like a image(jpeg or something like that). I know its a lot of trouble but I think it could be very helpful to me.</div>

<br>
What do you mean by visual support?&#xA0; What are you trying to be more accurate in/with or what exactly are you having trouble with? What are you trying to accomplish overall with this?<br>
<br>
The way I understand your question, the program YY-chr does what I think you are asking about.<br>
