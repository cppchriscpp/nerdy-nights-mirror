					Hi, it&apos;s been a couple of week since I&apos;m following those tutorial, there so great and make me feel close to my dream of making my own NES game week after week. 
<br>
<br>I have a couple of questions, I know that this tutorial is showing how do to generate background/ nametables manually but, you mention that there &apos;&apos;is  Some graphics tools [that] will generate this data&apos;&apos;. I would like to know:
<br>1) do you really do that method manually everytime you make a game or are you actually using a graphics tools like you mention that help you generate your nametable? the point is that I consider myself more an artist than a hard programmer. if you just could show me a program that could help me saving effort of hard coding something that I litteraly don&apos;t see. 
<br>2) If you use that kind of program, does it run on Window 8? or is there any that run on Window 8?
