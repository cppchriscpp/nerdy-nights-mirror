					Teach them wrong and get it to do something or teach them right and get it to do something, which am I supposed to go with as the tutorial seems to go more of the way of the former. I&apos;m trying to get him to do this so I can help him because as the code stands right now it&apos;s very, very confusing to figure out. I&apos;m just trying to help, but Khan is more than qualified and will probably help more then. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
