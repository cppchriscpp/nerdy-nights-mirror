		My question is, Is there a way that I could use the tiles/background patern table from the Mario bros file, and make a visual support with it. The goal is to make a visal reference that help me to be more accurate, like a image(jpeg or something like that). I know its a lot of trouble but I think it could be very helpful to me.</div>

	What do you mean by visual support?&#xA0; What are you trying to be more accurate in or what exactly are you having trouble with? What are you trying to accomplish overall with this?<br>
	<br>
	The way I understand your question, the program YY-chr does what I think you are asking about.</div>
I mean, instead of memories every tiles number, I&apos;ll make a complete picture (like a puzzle) of what I would like my background to look alike. Best exemple of what I&apos;m looking for is Pyxel Edit&#xA0; <a href="http://pyxeledit.com/images/tileExplanation.png" target="_blank">http://pyxeledit.com/images/tileE...</a><br>
