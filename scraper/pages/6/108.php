					I store everything as full backgrounds, using what I learned in MRN&apos;s compression tutorials (though I took out the repeat function since the costs outweighed the benefits at this time; meaning I like to see all of the tiles at once). Except for the status bar, which is loaded separately, and therefore saves six (three compressed) lines of data in memory per room. However, for the 64 rooms that I have up and running it only took a couple of days to program them in, and I enjoyed having the level of control that I did. But that&apos;s just me, and I&apos;m sure things will change in the future as I continue to learn.
