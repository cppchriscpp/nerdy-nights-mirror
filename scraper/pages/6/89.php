					alright thanks. this was just bugging me. actually my original problem was in the starting pong section but I figured it was because I missed something important in this section. I expanded on it and discovered this problem. So I wanted to make sure i got this understood first. I had to read what you said like 20 times to understand it. but after some sleep it made sense this morning. Thanks for the help. I&apos;ll probably be asking for more help in the next section later today if I can&apos;t figure it out.
