					Now I have a question concerning the graphic data in the PPU memory. Following the source code, I clearly see that the CPU sends the two palettes for the background and the sprites, then the sprite data by DMA into the SPR-RAM. However, I don&apos;t see the part where the pattern tables, the name tables and their attribute tables are sent to the PPU memory. Is there a directive that does this job ?
