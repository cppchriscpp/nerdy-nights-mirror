					Okay, I used the wrong address. $202 has the pallet selection for sprites. Look at the last 2 bits on the attributes byte. It&apos;s clearly outlines in the first post with the meaning of the attribute bit. Look under SPRITES and then SPRITE DATA.
<br>
<br>And the nametables you&apos;ll get to later. Basically it works the same way. 2 bits per tile group select the pallet they&apos;ll use.
