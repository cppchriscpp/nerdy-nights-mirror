	Basically when you play a Nintendo game, the player isn&apos;t a square is he? Mario has a shape, Link has a shape, etc, etc. Without a transparent color to tell the Nintendo which pixels to draw invisible, everything would be a square or rectangle.</div>

ahhh, that makes sense now. There are only two paletes one for sprites and one for background ? All colors that are represented within a game exist within these two palettes ? Their adress in the PPU is brought up by the accumulator through operands in the PRG Rom. Does that make any sense ? Am I getting this at all ?
