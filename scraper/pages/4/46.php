					Yeah that&apos;s exactly what I thought, it is quite strange how the y-coordinate is effected by comparing the value stored at memory address $10 and not the value #$10. Especially because I am not doing anything with the addresses which hold the y-coordinates. I think it might actually have to do with how I wrote the address (even though that wasn&apos;t intended), normally they are written as a 4 digit hex value, I think that&apos;s the key, it&apos;s incorrect syntax.
