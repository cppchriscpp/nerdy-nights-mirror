					Ok and this 256 bytes long memory is called the SPR-RAM. Now I understand why the DMA only needs the origin of the memory in the PPU side : every DMA transfer copies 256 bytes starting from a specified byte in the CPU memory, to the SPR-RAM located in the PPU.<br>

Thanks a lot, you really did help me there !
