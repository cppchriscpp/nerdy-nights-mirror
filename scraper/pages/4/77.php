	I hope this helps a little, but I&apos;m not too sure this is what you asked for.</div>

You and Khan helped a little. I was trying to change the colors in the directive .db. So, they have to have that first transparent color ? Why do they all have to have that ? I&apos;m still not understanding what is meant by high byte and low byte. What is their signifigance and why do you have to set them to a pallete value ?&#xA0; Looking forward to Swords and Ruins as I do every homebrew. Will it be released on here, Inifite NES lives or RetroUSB ?
