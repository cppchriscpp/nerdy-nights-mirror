					Writing #$00 to $2003 sets the OAM address (from $00 to $FF)<br>
Writing #$02 to $4014 sets the CPU RAM address (from $XX00 to $XXFF) and then begins the transfer from CPU RAM to OAM automatically<br>
00 and 02 are not High/low bytes of a single address, they are referring to different addresses<br>
<br>
Edit :<br>
fixed a typo : $2014 --&gt; $4014
