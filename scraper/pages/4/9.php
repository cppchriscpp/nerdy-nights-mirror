					Ah, so the 8 sprites per scanline even counts sprites that are turned off.
<br>
<br>So, is it necessary to read $2002 as a precaution every time you are writing addresses to the PPU registers?  Or are there only specific times?
<br>
<br>Is it best (or is it necessary) to turn off sprites &amp; background (using $2001) during all palette, sprite, and background updates?
<br>
<br>Thanks!
