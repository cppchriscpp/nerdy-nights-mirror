<br>Yes, changing the value you are storing to $0200 and $0203 will change the horizontal and vertical positioning.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not sure what color = 2 means.  You&apos;re writing 0 to the color, so it would take the first palette.  And also, the tile number you&apos;re writing is 0, and not 2. <img border="0" src="images/blank.gif" style="display: none;" original-src="/media/_images/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif"></div><br><br>Oops! I completely forgot that I changed 0 to 2 in the comments area thinking it would do something (silly me <img src="images/blank.gif" style="display: none;" original-src="/media/_images/expressions/face-icon-small-confused.gif">). My concern was how I can change the position of the sprite with out altering sprite 0.<br><br>Speaking of color, what address do I need to go to to change the color or palette of the sprite?<br>
