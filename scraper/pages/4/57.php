					i am heartly sorry sir, but i cann&apos;t understand wat you mean, can you expalin with detail? i think this is the thing which i wanted to hear...
<br>
<br>or can you post any website which contains the detailed information of the stuff you said?
<br>
<br>wat i understand is that the 16 byte data are 2 images of a tile, i.e. a pixel can be
<br>
<br>
<br>pixel 1:
<br>
<br>I tile   II tile
<br> 0          0
<br> 0          1
<br> 1          0
<br> 1          1
<br>
<br>and the result will contain the 2 bit of the color
<br>
<br>but i dont understand the line 
<br>&quot;The palette for sprites is selected by OAM bits on the 2nd byte of OAM ($201,205,etc.), &quot;
<br>
<br>because $0201 is the place to put the tile number to pick up the pattern from.
