	The first color in each of the 16 4-byte sections (designated here with x&apos;s) is the transparent color. Usually these all need to be the same, but I think basically whatever you have the first value set at, it will automatically make the other 7 first-bytes that same value. So don&apos;t be surprised if you try to change that color and nothing happens.</div>
Yup, just learned this tonight trying to program my game. Really threw a wrench into what I was doing. I was thinking I get 4 colors, but really, you get 3 and a bonus forth if it happens to be apart of the background.<br>
