					So, I tried to change the palete by changing the values in .db, but it just came up a black screen. Does the directives only use certain values in the palette based on the Chr rom ? Is this what is meant by High and low byte like the pallet is based off the value of high or low byte ?&#xA0; Also, not sure if it is covered latter on, but how do I start making a sprite from ground up ? I downloaded Nindraw the learning curve is hard to use. I wanted to fool around with changing the color and sprite formation for learning purposes. I opened up the mario.chr file with textedit and just got some weird unicode. What is that code or should I use like tile molester to open that up and mess with it ?
