					I was having some issues with the palette, so I tried to run the provided code for this section as a sanity check. Unfortunately I don&apos;t think I&apos;m getting the expected results.

<br>When I run sprites.nes in FCEUX I get this:

<br>
<br>Anyone know why the provided code may not be running as expected? It looks to me like some of the color palette isn&apos;t loading properly. The patterns table also looks a bit weird, but it may just be that this is the first patterns table I&apos;ve looked at since I&apos;m following along with the series.
