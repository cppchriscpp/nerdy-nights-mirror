					The problem lies in the NMI, the PPU or both.
<br>
<br>I have just tried a different appeoach and it works fine: I have kept the scrolling code in the NMI but it is branched by a variable flag enabled when the right button is pressed.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I should get more familiar with the NMI mechanism...
<br>Thank you!
