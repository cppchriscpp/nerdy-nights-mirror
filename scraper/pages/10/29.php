	So a game like centipede would use bank switching to animate the centipede and the objects that you shoot? I assume that each bank is still limited to the same 16 color pallete.</div>
<br>
I confused myself. I now see that the animation is the shifting of the enemy back and forth plus they change their form.<br>
<br>
I could see how it would be useful in the first example.<br>
<br>
Is bank switching how they built Mega Man? I know there was a trick they used in order to get his face a different color than the rest of his body to trick the 4 color limit.<br>
