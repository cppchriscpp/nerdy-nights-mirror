					I understand what is happening here, but can I get some examples on why this would be used? Is it just for getting an extra set of character tiles if you run out of room in the first?<br>
<br>
The hardest part of learning the code in NES 6502 is understanding why you must do something. Most of the time I can follow the code and understand what it does, I&apos;m just not far enough along to see how it will be useful.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance. I know I keep on bringing up dead threads. My bad.
