					Basically in the game MRN posted, it switches between the two banks to animate the background, instead of attempting to update every single background tile one by one.  The two banks have the two &quot;frames&quot; of animation, with the same tiles being used for the same enemy in both sets, so when the bank switches, all tile numbers stay the same but it animates.

<br>I&apos;ve personally used it for his first example: I generally try to make my title screens a little fancier, so I use an entire pattern table for it.  Then I have another pattern table for the gameplay.  That way I don&apos;t have to try to piece something together from the random tiles I have for the main part of the game.  Although I did this for Study Hall and it turned out pretty cool. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span>
