					Hey, totally random question on a blast-from-the-past thread... <img src="images/blank.gif" border="0" style="display: none;" original-src="/media/_images/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif"> This method works for me when I&apos;m using 2 or 4 CHR banks. However, games with 3 CHR banks do not pull from the proper tileset when running on the PowerPak/NES. (They work fine in Nintendulator, though.) A game that uses 3 CHR banks will only work for me if I set .ineschr to 4 and duplicate one of the banks. I&apos;m continuing to experiment, but I wonder if anyone has any thoughts as to why this might be happening. Just curious.
