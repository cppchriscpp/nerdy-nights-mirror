					In the 8x8 tiles, the pixles are specified with colors 1-4 of the pallette you specify.
<br>
<br>There are 4 background palletts (of 4 colors each) that can be active at one time.  
<br>
<br>So, the tile can be displayed with any of the 4 active palletts.
<br>
<br>It is not additive or multiplicitive like you&apos;re suggesting.
