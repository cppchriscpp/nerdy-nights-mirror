					I have a couple other questions. Is the information on the cart viewed as part of the CPU by the console? I see it on the CPU map diagram. Also, if I keep making bigger and bigger cartridges won&apos;t they eventually push the system too far? Like how Action 52 and other multicarts can overheat?
