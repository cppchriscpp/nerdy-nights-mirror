					Question: The first table above shows a layout of the various addresses and what they are for. The second table goes into further detail for $0000 thru $3FFF and shows $2000 thru $23C0 as being a name table of 30x32 tiles.
<br>
<br>1) What exactly is a name table? (I&apos;m not a programmer)
<br>
<br>2) How come later on in the tutorial specific values/settings are stored in the low $2000&apos;s? These don&apos;t seem to be related to tiles.
