.... what... the hell... is going on here?...... <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_sad"></span><br>
<br>
0+1=4?.. wat?!?! --- essentially the +1 is making me go &apos;waaaat?!?!&apos; most of all..&#xA0;<br>
0+1*2upperbits&amp;lowerbits, so this = 4 sure sure.. but.. ... what????<br>
<br>
the 2 +1*2upper&amp;lower makes 6, so seems to fit fine.. but.... .. what?! (doesnt seem to fit with all the other info.. I dunno..)<br>
<br>
(been sittin here 20 mins lookin at it feeling my brain tie up into a supercurly knot.. q.q .. <span class="sprites_emoticons absmiddle" id="emo_smile"></span> )<br>
<br>
(note, i r nubish@this..)<br>
<br>
- it seems like it&apos;s extremely simple to understand, so moving past this without figuring it out makes me feel like Im ignoring a chest that takes a very easy jump just cuz I cant find the right pixel to jump from.. which imo *should* be there...<br>
something like that anyway..
