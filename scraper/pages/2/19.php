					technically yes, but you&apos;re failing to get the basic point. The basic point it to quickly calculate kb to KB. 8kb = 1KB so if you had 32kb and wanted to know how many KB you have take 32 and divide it by 8, you get 4. that means 32kb is the same as 4KB. Rather than doing it the long way and going 8, 16, 24, 32 in 8 kb increments it&apos;s faster and easier to do the divide by method.
