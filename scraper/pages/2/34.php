	Ok, so I&apos;ve been writing these guides down inside a notebook,and I need toknow: can I get a listof what exactly the 16 colors used in the example chart are? like I know #7 is white but what about the rest?</div>
Your code picks the 16 color palette, so that number/color chart is not something to memorize.<br>
