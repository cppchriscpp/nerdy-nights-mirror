					So wait...SMB can hold only of 512x240 pixels of background data at a time? So as I&apos;m scrolling through the level, they continually update as I&apos;m running along?
<br>
<br>How does the background data update? Does each individual pixel update, or does it update in increments of X amount of pixels at a time?
<br>
<br>Also, I assume the audio data is stored in PRG correct? Only graphics (background and sprite) are stored in CHR, right?
