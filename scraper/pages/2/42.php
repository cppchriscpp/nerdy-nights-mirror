					There are 2 separate computers in the NES. One is the PRG-ROM, which only sees the CPU ROM. The other is the CHR-ROM, which is used by the PPU for the graphics. BUT if RAM is here, the CPU and upload data to the PPU-RAM. But, they are 2 entirely separate computers. And no, the hardware can do what it can do and that is the limit, cart size can get to as big as you ever need it. The heat problem is entirely bad cart hardware design, nothing about the limits of the system, there are systems in place in the chips and such to make sure even big hardware doesn&apos;t use that much power.
