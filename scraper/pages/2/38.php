					The pattern table for that example is using attribute table 1 (remember, we&apos;re using hex here), which basically means it&apos;s only using colors 4-7.  (Attribute table 0 would use 0-3, Attribute table 2 would use 8-11, etc).
<br>
<br>The pattern table numbers are showing which color each pixel is using from that attribute table.
<br>
<br>The 0s are using the first color out of the second set of attribute colors, which would be color 4 (or black).
<br>The 1s are using the second color out of the second set of attribute colors, which would be color 5 (or red).
<br>The 2s are using the third color out of the second set of attribute colors, which would be color 6 (or yellow).
<br>If there were any 3s, it would use white.
