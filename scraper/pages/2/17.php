					no, you take 8 kilobits (8kb) divide that by 8 and you get 1kiloByte (1KB)<br>

---Edited for a mundane comparison to help clarify ---<br>
<br>
Imagine that kilobits are like pennies and that KiloBytes are like dollars. now you have 100 pennies, if you divided that by 100 you get $1 but in computer memory schemes (most not all as there are others) it&apos;s in 8&apos;s instead of 10&apos;s or 100&apos;s<br>
