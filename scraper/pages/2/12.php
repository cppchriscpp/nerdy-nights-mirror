					can&apos;t get, how the graphics are made <img src="/media/_images/expressions/face-icon-small-sad.gif" border="0" style="display: none;">
<br>in the pattern table, the 8*8 tile is stored, and it contains 64 bits (every bit contains information bout the color) ??
<br>
<br>and then in the attribute table, are there more information about the color and this is added to the pattern table?
<br>
<br>so e.g. in pattern table first pixel has &quot;5&quot; and by the attribute table &quot;2&quot; is added, so the final pixel is in &quot;7&quot; (white) and in the position that is set in the pattern table???
<br>
<br>sry for complicated question, hope someone can help me or at least understand what i want to know ^^
